0,"This paper proposes a class of neural processes that lifts the limitations of conditional neural processes (CNPs) and produces dependent/correlated outputs but that, as CNPs, is inherently scalable and it is easy to train via maximum likelihood. The proposed model is extended to multi-output regression and to capture non-Gaussian output distributions. Results are presented on synthetic data, an electroencephalogram dataset and on a climate modeling problem. The paper parameterizes the prediction map as a Gaussian, where the mean and covariance are determined using neural networks. Non-Gaussian prediction maps are obtained using copulas. 

Technically speaking, the reviewers found the approach to be incremental and only marginally significant and I agree with them. Issues such as estimates of computational cost, using fixed lengthscales for the covariances and relationships/using normalizing flows have been addressed by the authors satisfactorily. Empirically, the contribution of the paper is somewhat significant, as it provides similar flexibility to other more computationally expensive processes and more general assumptions than conditional neural processes.

1,"Exploration can happen at various levels of granularity and at different times during an episode,  and this work performs a study of the problem of exploration (when to explore/when to switch between exploring and exploitation, at what time-scale to do so, and what signals would be good triggers to switch). The study is performed on atari games.

Strenghts:
------------
The study is well motivated and the manuscript is overall well written
Studies a new problem area, and proposes an initial novel method for this problem
extensive study on atari problems

Weaknesses
--------------
some clarity issues as pointed out by the reviewers
no illustrative task is given to give a more intuitive exposition of the ""when to explore"" problem
comparison to some extra baselines like GoExplore would have been insightful

Rebuttal:
----------
Most clarity issues have been addressed satisfactorily. It has been explained why some requests for extra baselines would be challenging/or not relevant enough. While the authors agree that GoExplore would be an interesting baseline, they seem to have not added it. An illustrative task was not provided.

All reviewers agree that this manuscript opens up and tackles a novel direction in exploration, and provides an extensive empirical study on atari games (a standard benchmark for such problem settings). While I agree with the reviewers that point out that this paper could have been made stronger by adding an illustrative task and additional baselines like GoExplore, there is a general consensus that the provided empirical study on this novel problem setting is a good contribution in itself. Because of this I recommend accept.

Reviewers agree that the method is interesting and the paper is well-written. The biggest concern from reviewers related to experimental evaluations of the method. The authors responded to this and included additional experiments. Although the reviewers appreciate the provided results and explanations, at the end they were not convinced about the empirical assessments. In particular, R1's post rebuttal comment indicates concerns about the reported performance of GCKN, which is different from the published one in Table 1 of GCKN paper.

The norm-bound perturbations considered here are a sufficiently interesting unsolved problem in the community and a clear prerequisite to solving the broader network robustness problem.) 

However, many of the reviewers also agreed that the theoretical assumptions - and, in particular, the random initialization of the weights - greatly oversimplify the problem.

5,"This paper proposes a relatively complicated method for source-free unsupervised domain adaptation, which integrates several techniques into a divide and contrast framework. The idea of dividing the target data into source-like subset and target-specific subset and employing global alignment and feature consistency for each subset is novel when the source data is inaccessible. The contrastive learning and memory-based MMD are novel in the context of source-free domain adaptation and introduce theoretical benefits in terms of the expansion theory and domain alignment theory, respectively.

6,"This paper explores the use of partial rejection control (PRC) for improved SMC-based variational bounds. While an unbiased SMC variant with PRC has been previously introduced by Kudlicka et al. (2020), this work introduces innovations that can help apply such ideas to variational inference. These bounds result in improvements in empirical performance. 

This paper was heavily discussed, with significant engagement by both the authors and the reviewers. Most reviewers recommended acceptance of this paper, with one reviewer (R4) recommending against acceptance. R4's central concerns regard the novelty of the proposed approach and its positioning relative to the existing SMC literature. The authors argued vigorously in the comments that this paper should be judged as a contribution to the VI literature and not the SMC literature.  Unfortunately, I will recommend that this paper is rejected. It is my opinion that R4's concerns were not fully addressed.

On the one hand, I agree with the authors that there is significant value to be had in exploring variants of SMC for VI. Indeed, some prior art, like FIVO and IWAE, contributed little to the Monte Carlo literature. I believe that these were good contributions.

On the other hand, I am concerned that the current draft does not clearly circumscribe its contributions. I read the sections that disuss the works of Schmon et al. (2019) and Kudlicka et al. (2020), and the writing did not leave me with a clear enough sense of the differences. I also read the abstract and introduction of the paper. The introduction of the paper positions this work clearly within the VI literature, but does not clearly discuss prior SMC art, e.g., it does not cite Kudlicka et al. (2020). Despite citing rejection control for SMC, the writing of the abstract and introduction left me with the impression that this work was the first to introduce *unbiased, partial* rejection control for SMC. I believe that impressions matter and that the machine learning community should be generous to adjacent communities when assigning credit.

I realize that my decision is a matter of taste. I also want to say that I am confident that the authors have a clear sense of where their contribution sits, and I suspect that it is a valuable contribution. However, I cannot recommend the draft in its current form. If this is a contribution to the VI literature, as the authors argue, then the authors should not hesitate to give full credit to prior SMC art. My reading of the current draft still leaves me confused about which aspects of the SMC estimator are actual contributions.

It is claimed that two limitations (myopia of MG and restricted consideration of geometry of search space) that most of existing methods have can be resolved by the MBG with a properly chosen pseudo-metric.

The authors also establish conditions that guarantee performance improvements and show that metric can be sued to control meta-optimization.

The addition of CelebA downstream task evaluation begins to address this concern of real-world data, but more rigorous experiments (including more description of how models were selected) and discussion of the limtiations of the proposed method are needed.

22,"Thank the authors for their submission.

The paper studies combinatorial multi-armed bandit with probabilistically triggered arms. That is an MAB setting in which, at each round, the learner chooses a subset of the arms and obtains a reward that is some function of expected rewards of the chosen arms. In addition, the learner only observes feedback on a random subset of her chosen arms (triggered arms). 

The paper relaxes a smoothness assumption laid by a previous work, and further improves the dependence on K in the regret bound, where K is the batch size (maximum number of triggered arms)
The authors provide computationally-efficient algorithms that are based on Bernstein concentration inequality, facilitating the improved bounds. 
The paper is well-written and organized, and the theoretical results are sound.

","This paper considers the combinatorial semi-bandits problem under two settings: (1) probabilistically triggered arms setting where the set of played arms can trigger reward on other arms, (2) the non-triggering setting with independent arms . For both these settings the authors improve batch-size dependence in regret as compared to previous work .

23,"The authors propose a semi-supervised novelty detection method which tries to identify out-of-distribution samples in the unlabeled data (consisting of in- and out-distribution samples) using a disagreement score of an ensemble. The ensemble is generated by fine-tuning the trained classiifer on the labeled training data plus the unlabeled data which all get a fixed label (which is repeated several times to generate the ensemble). The main idea is that one uses early stopping based on an in-distribution validation set in order to avoid overfitting on the unlabeled points which allows then identification of the out-distribution points via the disagreement score.

The reviewers appreciated the simplicity of the approach and the extensive experimental results. The authors did a good job in trying to answer all questions and concerns of the reviewers. 

However, some concerns remained:
- the setting assumes that the OOD data is fixed which was considered as partially unrealistic and thus evaluation of the OOD detection performance on unseen OOD distributions was requested in order to understand the limitations of the method (this was only partially done by the authors). 
- the theoretical result is for a two-layer network and completely based on previous work. As the authors use much deeper networks later on in the experiments, this result cannot be used to theoretically justify the approach. 
- there remained concerns about the necessary diversity of the ensemble and the early stopping procedure

While I think that the paper has its merits, it is not yet ready for publication. I encourage the authors to to take into account the above points and other remaining concerns of the reviewers in a revised version.

","The paper presents an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning method for novelty detection . The training resembles a self-training algorithm that labels the unlabeled pool and uses implicit regularization via early-stopping .

25,"This paper empirically demonstrates the sensitivity of unsupervised OD methods to hyperparameters and proposes ensembles of models with differing hyperparameters along with training techniques based on weight sharing to do so efficiently. 

The authors provided additional experiments to answer some reviewer's major concerns regarding the (meta-)HP robustness of the ensemble methods. While there are natural fluctuations with respect to the (meta) hyperparameters, a larger number of hyperparameters included usually resulted in a close to optimal AUROC.

Another concern for two reviewers was the extendability of the efficient ensemble training techniques to other models such as GANs etc. As the authors replied, even though skip connections might not be adaptable to other techniques, e.g. for ensembling various widths, zero-masked layers with BatchEnsemble would also be broadly applicable to ensemble-learn other unsupervised representation learning models. Perhaps in the final version, the authors further discuss with a short experiment how the AE-specific scaling techniques add to the performance.

A further concern was the lack of theoretical underpinning about the (meta)HP-robustness. Given that the reviewers agree that this paper provides ample empirical evidence and praise the experimental value, we think theoretical work (providing HP sensitivity results is highly nontrivial in general, let alone for neural networks) can be part of future work but the lack of it in the current manuscript should not prevent the publication of this work.

29,"This paper studies the problem of producing distribution-free prediction sets using conformal prediction that are robust to test-time adversarial perturbations of the input data. The authors point out that these perturbations could be label and covariate dependent, and hence different from covariate-shift handled in Tibshirani et al 19, the label-shift handled in Podkopaev and Ramdas 21, and the f-divergence shifts of Cauchois et al 2021. 

The authors propose a relatively simple idea that has appeared in other literatures like optimization but appears to be new to the conformal literature: (i) use a smoothed (using Gaussian noise on X, and inverse Gaussian CDF) nonconformity score function, in order to control its Lipschitz constant, (ii) utilize a larger score cutoff than the standard 1-alpha quantile of calibration scores employed in conformal prediction. The observation that point (i) alone lends some robustness to adversarial perturbations of the data is interesting. As several experiments in the paper and responses to reviewers show, this comes at the (apparently necessary) price of larger prediction sets. 

I read through all the comments and also the supplement. The authors have responded very well to all the reviewers questions/concerns, adding significant sections to their supplement as a result. Three reviewers are convinced, but one remaining reviewer requested additional experiments to compare with Cauchois et al (in addition to all the others already produced by the authors originally and in response to reviewers). However, the authors point out that the code in the aforementioned paper was not public, but they were able to privately get the code from the authors during the rebuttal period. At this point, I recommend acceptance of the paper even without those additional experiments, since it is not the authors' fault that the original code was not public. Nevertheless, I suggest to the authors that, if possible, they could add some comparisons to the camera-ready since they now have the code.

I congratulate the authors on a nice work, a very solid rebuttal, and also the astute reviewers on pointing out various aspects that could be improved. 

Minor point for the authors (for the camera-ready): I would like to comment on the Rebuttal point 4.4 in the supplement, which then got further discussed in the thread. The reviewer points out four references [R1-R4]. I will add one more to the list [R5] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10634.pdf (Kivaranovic et al, appeared in 2019, published in 2020). I think the literature reviews in this area are starting to be messy, and all authors need to do a better job. Clearly, the original paper of Vovk et al already establishes various types of conditional validity (and calls it PAC-style guarantee), produces guarantees that others in this area produce, and it appears that much recreation of the wheel is occurring. For eg, [R2, R4] do not cite [R5], despite [R5] appearing earlier and being published earlier, and having PAC-style guarantees and experiments with neural nets, etc. However, in turn, [R5] do not cite Vovk [R1], but [R2, R4] do cite [R1]. (And [R3] does not seem to be relevant to this discussion of conditional validity?) In any case, I am not sure any of these papers need citing since the current paper does not deal with conditional validity. If at all, just one sentence like ""Conditional validity guarantees, of the styles suggested by Vovk [2012], would be an interesting avenue for future work"".

32,"This paper proposes a method for learning physics combining symbolic computation and learning in an interesting way, targeting sample efficiency. At the initial evaluation, it was on the fence but leaning towards acceptance, with 3 slightly positive and one slightly negative review. 

The strengths lie in the combination between symbolic reasoning and statistical ML with a formulation around the classical EM framework. On the other hand, an important issue of the paper is its quite simplistic evaluation on now very easy problems and benchmarks. While benchmarks tend to be simple in the field of learning physics, current work does address more difficult problems than the problems tackled in this paper.

Another issue discussed was the simple trade-off in injecting hand-crafted inductive bias into a system leading to increased sample efficiency, which was perceived as unsurprising by some reviewers. While this is common in ML, and even strongly more so in learning physics from data synthetically generated with known physical laws, it was perceived to be particularly unsurprising in this paper where the benchmarks are indeed very simple and the laws directly encoded.

The AC discussed this paper with the PCs, and it was judged that the weaknesses in evaluation, in particular the simplicity of the tasks, cannot compensate for the interesting hybrid symbolic/ML formulation, and decided to reject the paper.

39,"This paper proposes environment fields, a representation that models reaching distances within a scene. Dense environment fields are learnt using a neural network, and the effectiveness of this representation is shown on 2D maze environments and 3D indoor environments. This paper received hugely contrasting reviews, with two reviewers being very supportive and one reviewer providing the lowest score of 1. In light of this, I'll start with providing my takeaways on the review and discussion with reviewer z3Y4 (rating of 1) and then proceed to the remaining discussion.

Reviewer z3Y4 has provided the score of 1 and has made strong remarks that include: ""what is proposed in this paper is simply not comprehensible"", ""description of the method itself is simply devoid of all required detail"", ""The main claims of the paper are incorrect or not at all supported by theory or empirical results."" and "" what is being proposed in this paper is simply too unclear and vague to be assessed"". **Such dismissive remarks, in my opinion, are completely unnecessary and create a toxic discussion and review environment.**

Reviewer z3Y4 has many criticisms of the submission, but the primary ones include: (a) the lack of details throughout the paper (b) the positioning of the paper in the abstract and introduction, and (c) the lack of experiments in continuous environments. Re (a): It is well understood in our research community that providing every last detail in the main submission is nearly impossible due to the restriction on the number of pages. Providing excess details in the main paper also often reduces the readability of the paper. Such details are better addressed in the appendix and crucially, the code. The authors have provided some details in the appendix and have indicated that they will release a code base.  I also agree with the authors that justifying every last detail in the network architecture such as choice of an activation function is not necessary for this submission. The same goes with describing methods in past works in detail vs referring the reader to the appropriate citation. As a result, I believe that the authors have addressed (a) well. Re (b): This has also been addressed by the authors, by pointing out relevant parts of the paper that had the necessary details. Re (c): In this regard, the paper clearly contains a well laid out experiment in 3D indoor scenes, so as far as I am concerned, this has been addressed in the main submission.

Reviewers AhgQ and fAEP have supported this submission but also laid out some concerns that include:
(1) Are the gradients suboptimal ?
(2) Positioning the paper with regards to past works
(3) Motivation behind using the VAE
(4) Qualitative analysis and failures
The authors have addressed these 4 concerns well using the rebuttal as well as via a revision of the appendix. The reviewers, post discussion have indicated their satisfaction with the revised submission.

40,"The paper proposes a supervised adversarial method for disentangling the latent space of a VAE into two groups: latents z which are independent of the given attribute y, and \hat{y} which contains information about y. Since the encoder also predicts \hat{y} it can be used for classification and the paper shows competitive results on this task, apart from the attribute manipulation task. Reviewers had raised points about model complexity and connections to prior works which the authors have addressed and the paper is on the borderline based on the scores. 

Though none of the reviewers explicitly pointed out the similarity of the paper with Fader networks (Lample et al., 2017), the adversarial setup for getting attribute invariant 'z' is exactly same as in Fader networks, as also pointed out in an anonymous comment. The only difference is that encoder in the current paper also predicts the attribute itself (\hat{y}), which is not the case in Fader n/w, and hence the encoder can be used as a classifier as well (authors have also mentioned and discussed this difference in their response). However, the core idea of the paper as outlined in the title of the paper, ie, using adversarial loss for information factorization, is very similar to this earlier work, which diminishes the originality of the work. 

With the borderline review scores, the paper can go in either of the half-spaces (accept/reject) but I am hesitant to recommend an ""accept"" due to limited originality of the approach. However, if there is space in the program, the paper can be accepted.

43,"This paper presents a large corpus of Korean legal documents, paired with labels corresponding to two classification tasks, two legal judgment prediction tasks, and one summarization task. Reviewers praised the uniqueness of the new resource.

However, there is some criticism of the results section, with several reviewers bringing up possible comparisons to other models and wondering whether the performance of this model has been analyzed thoroughly.  The authors argue in particular that mT5 and KoGPT-2 can benefit from continued pre-training this corpus, which seems satisfactory, although there is the question raised by 7fpy that this is essentially pre-training on the test tasks and may be too generous when assessing the performance on other legal-domain tasks that arise down the road.  Reviewer 7fpy brings up some valid critiques of the dataset construction: several points about filtering were unclear, as was the strength of the automatic pipeline used to construct the dataset.

There are a few ethical concerns raised by the ethics reviewer, which I believe are serious. Point [1] is resolved. Point [2] about misuse seems valid and harder to argue against.  The data does have value for use in the kind of more benign studies the authors report in the response there. But its very existence could encourage the construction of certain kinds of automated tools for legal judgment prediction, which has been a hotly-debated issue in the NLP community before. Ultimately I will defer to the ethics reviewer on this one, who seems satisfied.

Overall this paper seems like a well-done effort. The main question is whether its utility (modulated by issues with the results) outweighs the risks of putting it out there. Reviewers seem to lean positive on this and I would lean positive as well.

44,"This paper introduces the first NAS benchmarks on graphs. Ratings were quite diverse, with scores of 4,5,6,7,7,8.
The many positive reviewers highlighted that GraphNAS is very relevant and that a benchmark for them would be very useful for the community. The benchmark includes comprehensive evaluations on as many as 9 different datasets, which may also help facilitate research on meta-learning for (Graph)NAS. Initially, the code for creating the benchmark and analysis was not available, which is a no-go for tabular NAS benchmarks, but the authors fixed this in the rebuttal period.
The most negative reviewer, 8asK, appears to not be familiar with tabular NAS benchmarks and their usefulness, and did not react to the discussion about it, as well as to the modification of the paper to highlight it. The other borderline negative review, by reviewer LkTe, had as their main ciriticism that NAS methods should be benchmarked on many spaces, but the point of tabular NAS benchmarks is *not* to provide a conclusive assessment of the performance of NAS methods that holds in general across search spaces (as a ""horserace"" paper might try to achieve), but rather to facilitate the cheap evaluation of current and future NAS methods on a single search space. For these reasons, I do agree more with the positive reviewers and recommend acceptance of this work as a poster.

45,"This paper proposes an architecture of a policy network (WaveCorr) that is particularly effective for portfolio management tasks.  A key observation that leads to the design of WaveCorr is that the dependency across asset should be treated differently from the dependency across time.  The proposed WaveCorr has the property that it is ""permutation invariant"" with respect to assets, which means that the class of functions that can be represented by WaveCorr is invariant to permutation of assets.  WaveCorr is shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in a portfolio management task.

A major point of discussion was the definition of ""permutation invariance"".  The reviewers and AC understood the difference between the permutation invariance defined in this paper and that studied in the prior work (the output of a network is insensitive to the permutation of the particular values of the input).  With the definition in this paper, however, a fully connected layer is permutation invariant, but the Corr layer proposed in the paper appears to have more structure.  It is unclear exactly what properties of the Corr layer leads to the performance improvement.

Based on those empirical observations, they propose a simplified model with layer reduction and single-stage distillation, which do not rely on a complicated and ad-hoc training strategy. Extensive experiments are conducted with thorough comparison with existing works. Authors also clearly point-out their current limitations.

The major concern is that this paper is more focused on discussion of the effectiveness of training strategies in previous methods, while the theoretical contribution is somehow limited. It would be much better if authors could explain their observations (more training epochs is needed while additional distillation stages can be discarded) from a theoretical perspective, although this may be far out of the scope of this work.

49,"This paper proposes a methodology to create cheap NAS surrogate benchmarks for arbitrary search spaces. Certainly, the work is interesting and useful, with comprehensive studies to validate such approach. It should be credited as belonging to the first efforts of introducing and comprehensively studying the concept of surrogate NAS benchmarks. In AC's opinion, it is a solid paper that will (or has already) inspire many follow up works. The paper is well written. 

This paper received highly mixed ratings. Although the authors might not see, all reviewers actually participated in the private discussions. Reviewer 1eb8 indicated hesitation in her/his support. Reviewer yTPb stated that if not considering the arXiv complicacy, she/he ""would certainly raise score by one level"".  AC also reached out to Reviewer yTPb about her/his mentioned possibility of updating scores, and got confirmed that her/his original opinions wasn't changing after rebuttals. Besides, AC agrees the arXiv/NeurIPS complicacy shouldn't brought into the current discussion, and ignored that factor during decision making. 

The main sticking (and considered-as-valid) critique is on the relatively outdated and incomplete selection of baselines. As a benchmark paper, it should capture and diversify the recent methods.

67,"The authors present BASGD and asynchronous version of SGD that attempts to be robust against byzantine failures/attacks. 
The papers is overall well written and clearly presents the results. Some novelty is present as there have been limited work in asynchronous algorithms for byzantine ML. 

However, there have been several concerns raised by the reviewers, on which I agree, and they have not been fully addressed:
1) the tradeoff between asynchrony and robustness, as BASGD cannot handle the case of a buffer being straggler, which limits some of the novelty in this work
2) issues with the definition of privacy leakage has not been fully addressed
3) some reviewers mentioned the theoretical results being of limited importance, but arguably this is true for other related work in this area. Perhaps a general criticism is valid as to what is the operational value of the proposed guarantees. That is convergence does not exclude a model that has undesirable properties, eg has bad prediction accuracy for a small subset of tasks.
4) Finally, the motivation of the system model of the paper ( eg storing gradients as opposed to instances) paper is of unclear practical relevance, as was raised by multiple reviewers.

68,"This paper studies post-training quantization by proposing Network-Wise Quantization (NWQ) an end-to-end quantization approach that takes into account relationships between layers rather than treating layers independently. Using this approach, the paper demonstrates compelling empirical gains across a number of architectures and compression factors. Reviewers recognized the practical success of the approach as demonstrated by these empirical results and praised the clarity of the manuscript. However, there were concerns regarding the novelty of the approach and whether the proposed method is simply a composition of previous methods. While I understand these concerns, I think there is a significant delta between this work and previous approaches, especially when taking into account the markedly improved performance and the challenges of determining how to apply these lines of thinking to end-to-end training. The authors also expanded their discussion of these works in their updated manuscript, clarifying the differences. There were also concerns regarding the hyperparameter tuning, but the authors clarified in their response that the large majority of experiments used a constant set of hyperparameters, suggesting that these results are not simply the effect of tuning.

69,"This paper does two things. First, it proposes an approach to estimating the mutual information between the input, X, or target label, Y, and an internal representation in a deep neural network, L, using MINE (for I(Y;L)) or a variation on MINE (for I(X;L)) and noise regularization (estimating I(X;L+ε), where ε is isotropic Gaussian white noise) to avoid the problem that I(X;L) is infinite for deterministic networks and continuous X. Second, it attempts to validate the information bottleneck theory of deep learning (Tishby and Zaslavsky, 2015) by exploring an approach to training DNNs that optimizes the information bottleneck Lagrangian, I(Y;L) − βI(X;L+ε), layerwise instead of using cross-entropy and backpropagation. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show improvements for the layerwise training over cross-entropy training. The penalty on I(X;L+ε) is described as being analogous to weight decay. The reviewers raised a number of concerns about the paper, the most serious of which is that the claim that the layerwise training results validate the information bottleneck theory of deep learning is too strong. In the AC's opinion, R1's critique that ""[i]f the true mutual information is infinite and the noise regularized estimator is only meant for comparative purposes, why then are the results of the training trajectories interpreted so literally as estimates of the true mutual information?"" is critical, and the authors' reply that ""this quantity is in fact a more appropriate measure for “compactness” or “complexity” than the mutual information itself"" undermines their claim that they are validating the information bottleneck theory of deep nets because the information bottleneck theory claims to be using mutual information. The AC also suggests that if the authors wish to continue this work and submit it to another venue, they (1) discuss the fact that MINE estimates only a lower bound that may be quite loose in practice and (2) say in their experimental section whether or not the variance of the regularizing noise was tuned as a hyperparameter, and if so, how results varied with different amounts of noise. Finally, the AC regrets that only one reviewer participated in the discussion (in a very minimal way), despite the reviewers' receiving several reminders that the discussion is a defining feature of the ICLR review process.

72,"The paper proposes new techniques for improving the generalization ability of deep learning models for Knowledge Tracing (KT). Instead of designing more sophisticated models, the paper investigates simple data augmentation techniques that can be applied to train existing models.

These strategies are then applied with appropriate regularization loss ensuring consistency and monotonicity in the training process. Extensive experiments are performed using three popular neural models for KT and four publicly available datasets. Overall, the paper studies an interesting problem in an important application domain of online education. The results are promising and open up several exciting follow-up research directions to explore more complex data augmentation techniques for KT.

77,"The AC has taken into account all strengths and weaknesses mentioned by reviewers in making a recommendation for this paper. Here is the summary of what was considered in carefully considering a final decision:

* Reviewers agree that the presented resource, the Dollar Street dataset, addresses a need for models that can be held more accountable in terms of geographic diversity and demographic diversity. 
* There is generally no issues in terms of methodology or soundness of the proposed resource.
* Unfortunately, experiments on demonstrating the usefulness of this resource are limited, and largely replicate what was already found in Devries et al. 2019, a workshop paper at CVPR from three years ago which also used the same source of data -- and at the same scale. The analysis in this previous paper in some way go further by matching image categories using human evaluators individually for each image -- as pointed out by reviewer dcyB.
* The dataset was downloaded from a third party's website and as such the authors had no control in how the images were collected, nor there was any effort to enhance this resource in terms of annotations, diversity or size.
* The dataset size is 38k images which is a rather small dataset for training or enhancing a model, and its use would be limited mostly as a benchmark dataset. As a benchmark however experiments seem limited as pointed by reviewer eAoC. An experiment on training on this dataset and evaluating on this dataset is performed only with a Resnet network, however it is hard to assess what is the significance of this experiment.

## Reviewer aaFn
**Strengths:**
- Novel algorithm.

**Weaknesses:**
- Potentially overfitting to the offline data.
- Data hungry approach.
- Confusion related to the occurrence moments of predicted future actions.
- Section 2 is difficult to understand.

## Key Takeaways and Thoughts
Overall, I think the problem setup is very interesting. However, as pointed out by reviewers gii5 and EgW5, due to the lack of baselines, it is tough to compare the proposed algorithm against other approaches, and this paper's evaluation is challenging. I would recommend the authors include more ablations in the future version of the paper and baselines and address the other issues pointed out above by the reviewers.

",This work studies a methodological framework to transform/approximate offline algorithms into their online counterparts . Main methodology is to predict an offline algorithm’s actions in the real time future via learning behavioral structures of the offline algorithm using past data . The authors claim to develop a general framework for **approximating offline algorithms using online algorithms** But the online algorithms trained in this paper do not directly attempt to approximate the offline algorithms .

82,"I thank the authors for their submission and active participation in the discussions. This paper introduces a method for learning a policy that can ask an expert for help, i.e., to obtain the expert action. On the positive side, reviewers found the method to be general [uya8], original and significant [gw2r], intruiging in terms of being able to reuse an existing policy [HGan], and tackling an important problem [rsmr,bRWC], and the paper to be clear [uya8,gw2r,rsmr,bRWC]. In terms of negative points, reviewers were concerned about the novelty [bRWC], unimpressive qualitative results despite strong quantitative results [bRWC], and issues with the range of baselines [bRWC,rsmr] and ablations considered [uya8]. Overall, the paper is borderline. However, bRWC indicated they would raise their score but I don't see this being reflected. Furthermore, in my view reviewer rsmr's concerns regarding baselines and ablations has been addressed by the author rebuttal. Thus, I am siding with reviewers gw2r and HGan, and recommend acceptance.

86,"Post discussion update
------------------------

The authors completed a rebuttal that addressed all of the reviewers' critiques, and also uploaded a revised and improved manuscript. The most significant improvement seems to be the addition of a small related work section in the introduction and a limitation plus future work section at the end of the paper. However, since the final paper has an 8 page limit, the current 9-page manuscript will need to be shortened. 

The clarifications seemed to sway two of the reviewers toward increasing their ratings. Generally, it's clear that although this is a non-standard paper, it raises interesting and potentially provocative points that would be great for the CORL community to discuss. Therefore, I am recommending acceptance.



Original review
----------------


This paper addresses the HRI challenge of measuring how well a robot has learned a user's reward function. It describes two main types of measures---parameter-based and reward-based---and provides both theoretical and empirical examples of the shortcomings of each. 


Strengths
* This seems like the type of paper that would be useful to assign in an HRI course or give to a new grad student, because it clearly explains the different measures and provides a comparison of them.

* Reviewers noted that the issues brought up by this paper are important and very relevant to current approaches. The paper is timely.

* Reviewers agreed that paper balances well between theory and empirical examples. 

* The paper was well written and easy to understand.


Weaknesses

* The main critique is that reviewers feel that the paper doesn't go deeply enough into the discussion of what to do with these findings. How should robotics researchers use this information to design better measures? In what cases are these measures likely to fail, or to be accurate? Section 6 poses such questions, but it would add substantially to the novelty of the paper if there was some suggestion of where to go from here.  

* Although the paper bills itself as a survey, reviewers noted that it doesn't provide much of a discussion of related work. Reviewers also provided additional citations that address some of the issues brought up regarding current measures of performance. 

* A couple of reviewers questioned the connection to robot learning in particular.

* There is no limitations statement, which is a required component.

","This paper analyzes and evaluates several different measures for evaluating reward learning . Authors provide theoretical worst-case analysis showing limitations of common measures and provide empirical tests across several domains .

87,"Authors present a method for single object tracking (SOT) that is entirely comprised of transformers. The architecture is simple: 

1) Swin is used to generate embeddings for both template and search region
2) Embeddings are concatenated
3) An encoder transformer performs MHSA of the embeddings.
4) A decoder performs cross-attention from search tokens to template tokens and a special ""motion token"" which is constructed from a linear operation over the prior motion trajectory relative to the frame. 
5) Output token is fed to final layers that perform IoU aware classification and bounding box regression.

Evaluations are performed on 5 SOT datasets, achieving SOTA on all of them.


Pros:
- [AC/R] Important problem, technically sound, and new SOTA on this task.
- [AC/R] New motion token approach is novel and provides significant improvement.
- [AC/R] Simple and elegant architecture
- [AC/R] Insightful discussions
- [AC/R] Clearly written and easy to follow
- [AC/R] Interesting ablations
- [AC/R] High frame rate

Cons:
- [R] Low novelty of transformer approach, but this is negated by the novelty of the motion token.
- [R] Details regarding pretraining are missing. Authors provide in response.
- [R] Motivation of motion token design is not clear. Authors provided further ablations of different implementations of the motion token, showing the current form performs best.
- [R] Provide additional details regarding where and how SwinTrack outperforms other approaches on the benchmarks. Authors provided additional granularity of performance stratifications within the LaSOT benchmark.
- [R] Add more recent high performing trackers. Authors added several methods published in 2022.
- [R] Some additional questions about various details were posed by reviewers, which will all answered by the authors.

90,"The paper's strength is in that it shows the log likelihood objective is lower bounded by a GAN objective plus an entropy term. The theory is novel (but it seems to relate closely to the work https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02771.) The main drawback the reviewer raised includes a) it's not clear how tight the lower bound is; b) the theory only applies to a particular subcase of GANs --- it seems that the only reasonable instance that allows efficient generator is the case where Y = G(x)+\xi where \xi is Gaussian noise. The authors addressed the issue a) with some new experiments with linear generators and quadratic loss, but it lacks experiments with deep models which seems to be necessary since this is a critical issue. Based on this, the AC decided to recommend reject and would encourage the authors to add more experiments on the tightness of the lower bound with bigger models and submit to other top venues.

91,"The paper proposes an interesting step in the direction of neuro-symbolic reasoning. While there is no consensus among reviewers about the key novelty of the method, all acknowledge the interest of the direction. All of them also recognize that the submission improved greatly during the discussion phase: clarification of motivations, of experimental settings and results, of discussion with previous work.

However, despite those improvements, the submission is not yet ready for publication at ICLR. We encourage the authors to use the very detailed reviews and comments to improve the work. In particular, we encourage them to pay attention at three aspects:

1/ Comparison with large language models: the discussion wrt T5 is important. A key motivation for the proposed model is that it is bringing information and elements for QA (or other reasoning tasks) that purely scaling up language models can not bring. Or maybe they can bring the same kind of improvement but at a much lower computational cost. In any case, this is a very important point to justify the interest of such approach, and neuro-symbolic reasoning overall, empirically.

2/ Using GPT2 (or equivalent): the discussion on using GPT-2 for generating new facts is key too. It is essential to bring this description from appendix to the core of the paper. But more discussion are expected.  For instance, what if GPT-2 generates facts that are false and lead to answering and justifying a wrong answer? In other words, how does it impact the integrity of the contextualized KG? This is an essential point that needs to be worked on more thoroughly. 

3/ Overall there have been a lot of discussion to improve the motivations and the contributions. But they are not reflected in the paper necessarily. Following R2, we encourage the authors to ""refocus the existing version (e.g., from vague discussion about neural-symbolic models towards establishing solid comparison to the most related previous work in various sections of the submission)""

93,"The paper's initial evaluation was below par, but the author feedback helped clarify several crucial points after which two of the reviewers increased their scores by a point, bringing the current evaluation to borderline. 

The paper addresses a relevant and challenging problem in the RL domain. However, in my opinion, from the reviewers' and authors' remarks and from my own reading of the paper, there are concerns that need to be addressed before the paper can be publication worthy. Primary among these is the quantum of novelty -- as many reviews point out, the key idea of viewing an episodic trajectory as a multivariate (vector) sample for running hypothesis tests is not novel in itself, as is the claim that new tests have been devised. Another crucial issue is the (parametric) assumption of normality for the episodic reward sequence which is not adequately justified in the paper -- even a two time-step trajectory with normal rewards per state transition can exhibit a mixture-of-Gaussians type reward distribution for the second state, breaking the assumption. As it transpired from the reviews of Reviewer4, reducing environment shift/degradation to just a mean change problem, without even considering a change in the variances (2nd order statistics), seems to be too stylized to be effective. There are other, nonparametric approaches in statistics based on testing for changes in the distribution function (kernel density estimation approaches, for instance), which could perhaps be applied without normality assumptions and yield favourable results. The experimental results for detection delay often show significant overlaps of the delay distributions for different procedures (e.g., Hotelling vs. Mean vs. UDT etc.), which does not indicate an advantage of the proposed method. 

I would urge the author(s) to assimilate the feedback and delve deeper as to why and how parametric procedures based on normality assumptions may or may not succeed, so as to significantly strengthen the theoretical and practical message of this work.

96,"The paper proposes a method to generate attention masks to interpret the performance of RL agents. Results are presented on a few ATARI games. Reviewers unanimously vote for rejecting the papers. R1, R3 give a score of 5, whereas R4, R5 give a score of 4. Their concerns are best explained in their own words: 

R1 says, ""The use of attention maps to analyze and explain deep neural networks is not new in itself, and learning attention maps to improve vision tasks is not new either.""

R3 says, ""the analysis of the learned attention masks seems selective. Some automatic metrics or systematic studies of different game categories (shooting, maze-like, and ball-and-paddle) may shed light on the learned attention's general property.""

R5 says, ""I am still not convinced by the quality of the provided visual explanations nor am I convinced that the attention is well correlated with the current frame (the additional experiments provided do help somewhat in this regard, but are not extensive and reasonably inconclusive""

In their rebuttal, to address R1's concern authors suggested that the use of attention on both value and policy networks is novel. This is not sufficient, because it does not show why such attention maps are more useful than ones proposed by prior work. As suggested by reviewers, a systematic study or a human study clearly showing that the proposed method adds more interpretability is critical. However, this is missing.  In response to R3, the authors provided experiments on more games. But this is not the point -- because it's not about the number of environments in which experiments are provided, but rather the nature of the analysis that is performed. Finally, R5 comments that it's unclear whether attention actually provided interpretability or not. 

Due to the lack of convincing analysis that demonstrates the utility of the proposed method in advancing the understanding of decisions made by RL agents, I recommend that the paper be rejected.

97,"The paper's stated contributions are:

(1) a new perspective on learning with label noise, which reduces the problem to a similarity learning (Ie, pairwise classification) task

(2) a technique leveraging the above to learn from noisy similarity labels, and a theoretical analysis of the same

(3) empirical demonstration that the proposed technique surpasses baselines on real-world benchmarks

Reviewers agreed that (1) is an interesting new perspective that is worthy of study. In the initial set of reviews, there were concerns about (2) and (3); for example, there were questions on whether the theoretical analysis studies the ""right"" quantity (pointwise vs pairwise loss), and a number of questions on the experimental setup and results (Eg, the computational complexity of the technique). Following a lengthy discussion, the authors clarified some of these points, and updated the paper accordingly.

At the conclusion of the discussion, three reviewers continued to express concerns on the following points:

- *Theoretical justification*. Following Theorem 3, the authors assert that their results ""theoretically justifies why the proposed method works well"". The analysis indeed provides some interesting properties of the reduction, such as the fact that it preserves learnability (Appendix F), and that the ""total noise"" is reduced (Theorem 2). However, a complete theoretical justification would involve guaranteeing that the quantity of interest (Ie, the clean pointwise classification risk) is guaranteed to be small under the proposed technique. Such a guarantee is lacking. 
  - This is not to suggest that such a guarantee is easy -- as the authors note, this might involve a bound that relates pointwise and pairwise classification in multi-class settings, and such bounds have only recently been shown for binary problems -- or necessary for their method being practical useful (per discussion following Theorem 3). Nonetheless, without such a bound, there are limits to what the current theory justifies about the technique's performance in terms of the final metric of interest.

- *Comparison to SOTA*. Reviewers noted that the gains of the proposed technique are often modest, with the exception of CIFAR-100 with high noise. Further, the best performing results are significantly worse than those reported in two recent works, namely, Iterative-CV and DivideMix. The authors responded to the former in the discussion, and suggested that they might be able to combine results with the latter. While plausible, given that the latter sees significant gains (Eg, >40% on CIFAR-100), concrete demonstration of this point is advisable: it is not immediately apparent to what extent the gains of the proposed technique seen on ""simple"" methods (Eg, Forward) would translate more ""complex"" ones (Eg, DivideMix).
  - In the response, the authors also mentioned that (at least the initial batch of) the experiments are intended to be a proof-of-concept. This would be perfectly acceptable for a work with a strong theoretical justification. However, per above, this point is not definitive.

- *Creation of Clothing1M*. The authors construct a variant of Clothing1M which merges the classes 3 and 5. Given that prior work compares methods on the original data, and that this potentially reflects noise one may encounter in some settings, it is advisable to at least report results on the original, unmodified version.

- *Issues with clarity*. There are some grammatical issues (Eg, ""is exact the""), typos (Eg, ""over 3 trails""), notational inconsistencies (Eg, use of C for # of classes in Sec 2, but then c in Sec 3.1), and imprecision in explanation (Eg, Sec 3.2 could be clearer what precise relationships are used from [Hsu et al. 2019]).
  - These are minor but ought to be fixed with a careful proof-read.

Cumulatively, these points suggest that the work would be served by further revision and review. The authors are encouraged to incorporate the reviewers' detailed comments.

100,"The authors propose a particle-based entropy estimate for intrinsic motivation for pre-training an RL agent to then perform in an environment with rewards.

What is novel here is the adaptation of this entropy estimate to form an intrinsic reward via a contrastive representation and the subsequent demonstration on standardized RL environments.  The authors have added a comparison to MEPOL, and in these experiments, APT outperforms this method, sometimes by some margin.

103,"This paper proposes a Role Diversity metric, meant to quantify how different roles are in a multi-agent RL setting. There's actually three versions of this metric, or three aspects (the distinction is not entirely clear to this area chair).

The reviewers are generally not very enthusiastic about the paper, with scores hovering at or just below the acceptance threshold. There has been extensive discussion between reviewers and authors, but there a sense that there is confusion about the exact purpose and contribution of the paper. This is reinforced by the authors' ""letter to area chair"", which outlines several ways the reviewers have not gotten the message. Reading the paper, it appears to me that the root cause is that the authors are indeed not communicating clearly what the paper contributes and why. It is, after all, the authors' responsibility that the reviewers understand the work. My own impression is that the text is dense and not particularly easy to get through. Perhaps the authors are simply trying to cram too many contributions into a single conference paper? This is a classic error which leads to hard-to-read papers.

107,"This works considers limitations of rehearsal-based methods in the context of continual learning (classification and object detection). Rehearsal-based methods provide a strong baseline, but a loss in predictive performance arises when the memory is limited in size. The authors propose to leverage compression (JPEG) to increase the number of data (images) stored in the memory. The approach is evaluated in the context of an autonomous driving application.

The additional experiments conducted by the authors were highly appreciated and helped clarify open questions (e.g., class-incremental learning set-up, DPP objective to determine size of the memory, quantity vs quality of compressed data, etc.). The authors addressed the issues raised by three out of four reviewers, who did not have further comments. The remaining reviewer found that the methodological contributions of this paper, namely of using compression in the context of CL, was pretty straightforward. However, the authors addressed the concerns raised by the reviewer regarding the selection of the compression quality q as far as I am concerned and conducted additional experiments to further demonstrate the usefulness of the approach. I would encourage the authors to include this discussion in the final version of the paper. I would also encourage them to include the additional experiments they conducted with fixed memory size and amount of memory that can be saved.

","In this paper, the problem of catastrophic forgetting for continual learning is explored .

110,"This paper describes how to use normalizing flows for selecting features in a way that controls the type-1 error by using a normalizing flow along with MCMC to sample from the null distribution. The majority of the reviewers were positive, however the most confident reviewer was negative. From taking a look at that reviewers concerns, I tend to agree with most of them.

The paper is titled knockoff-free, which means in the context of this paper that both 1) 1-bit p-values are not used and 2) The full knockoff property is not required, only sampling from complete conditionals are required. Most of the experiments compare knockoff methods to the proposed approach, so it's not clear if 1) 1-bit p-values are not great or 2) the model-X process/complete conditional sampling process is better with normalizing flows. The former point is known and the latter point on the best way to sample from the complete conditionals is really the value. 

If we take the paper as, 

1) complete conditionals are 1-D
2) MCMC can be used to sample from a 1-D unnormalized density
3) Simple MCMC won't be bad because the problem is 1-D

-> Any likelihood based deep generative model can be used to sample complete conditionals

then it's a solid paper.

On the other hand, the belief that flows are the correct choice versus other likelihood-based deep generative models is harder to take as there's only a comparison with a mixture density network used in the original HRT paper. Also from other uses of these models, different models are better in different situations. I'd suggest a heavy discussion in the paper on this point at the minimum. Maybe even a reframing of the paper is needed.

Finally, for the test statistic, the HRT may not be the best choice for work like this paper that studies the problems with estimating X-distribution. The  paper ""CONTRA: Contrarian statistics for controlled variable selection"" at AISTATS 2021 shows that the HRT test statistic is more sensitive to model-X estimation errors than a simple mixture statistic that doesn't give up much power. The choice of test statistic also merits some discussion in step 3.

TopicGAN operates in two steps: it first generates latent topics and produces bag-of-words corresponding to those latent topics. In the second step, the model generates text conditioning on those topic words.

Pros: 
It combines the strength of topic models (interpretable topics that are learned unsupervised) with GAN for text generation.

Cons: 
There are three major concerns raised by reviewers: (1) clarity, (2) relatively thin experimental results, and (3) novelty. Of these, the first two were the main concerns. In particular, R1 and R2 raised concerns about insufficient component-wise evaluation (e.g., text classification from topic models) and insufficient GAN-based baselines. Also, the topic model part of TopicGAN seems somewhat underdeveloped in that the model assumes a single topic per document, which is a relatively strong simplifying assumption compared to most other topic models (R1, R3). The technical novelty is not extremely strong in that the proposed model combines existing components together. But this alone would have not been a deal breaker if the empirical results were rigorous and strong.

Reject. Many technical details require clarification and experiments lack sufficient comparisons against prior art.

124,"Description of paper content:

The authors propose a dynamics model that can generalize to novel environments. The train and test MDPs have the same state and action spaces but different dynamics. Environment specific inference is achieved by estimating latent vectors Z that describe the non-stationary or variable part of the dynamics. These Z-s are inferred from trajectory segments in unlabeled environments. The Z-s are learned contrastively: Z-s from the same trajectory are pulled together, and Z-s from separate trajectories are pushed apart. However, to mitigate the error of distancing Z-s from different trajectories but the same environment, Z-s on trajectories with similar transitions are also pushed together using a soft clustering penalty. These losses are justified based on ideas from Pearl’s causal inference.

The reviewers concluded that the contributions are conceptually interesting and “somewhat” novel. The reviewers felt that the empirical performance gains of the method over baselines were demonstrated but not extremely impressive.

125,"In an attempt to understand generalization, this paper aims at understanding the dynamics of functions presented by the network for different images in the training set. Authors look at activation patterns (whether a ReLU activation is on or off) as a way of characterizing the active paths in the network and approximating the function presented by the network for each image. Authors study different related statics (eg. correlation) and how they evolve during training including.

Pros: 
- Understanding the dynamics of training, how diversity is encouraged by the training procedure and its relationship to generalization is an important problem.
- This paper takes an empirical approach and tries to make interesting empirical observations about the dynamics of the training.

Cons:
- The paper is poorly written in terms of structure, making clear arguments with enough evidence, notation, etc.
- Some empirical trends are shown but their connections to the main claim of the paper about generalization is very weak. The main attempt to connect the observations to generalization is Fig. 7 which shows model accuracy correlated with the ratio of early to mid overlap. This is problematic both because it only has 6 data points and also because a simple correlation analysis is not enough to establish this claim which is more about the cause of generalization.

Reviewers have pointed to various concerns including but not limited to clarity of the paper, lack of rigorous arguments, not providing enough evidence for the arguments, etc. Unfortunately, authors did not participate in the discussion period.

Given the above concerns, I recommend rejecting the paper.

126,"I'm quite concerned by the conversation with Anonymous, entitled ""Why is the dependence..."". My issues concern the empirical Rademacher complexity (ERC) and in particular the choice of the loss class for which the ERC is being computed. This  class is obviously data dependent, but the Reviewers concerns centers on the nature of its data dependence. It is not valid to define the classes by the Jacobian's norm on the input data, as this _structure_ over the space of classes is data dependent, which is not kosher. The reviewer was gently pushing the authors towards a very strong assumption... i'm guessing that the jacobian norm over all data sets was bounded by a particular constant. This seems like a whopping assumption. The fact that I can so easily read this concern off of the reviewer's comments and the authors seem to not be able to understand what the reviewer is getting at, concerns me.

Besides this concern, it seems that this paper has undergone a rather significant revision. I'm not convinced the new version has been properly reviewed. For a theory paper, I'm concerned about letting work through that's not properly vetted, and I'm really not certain this has been. I suggest the authors consider sending it to COLT.

136,"This paper provides an interesting generalized perspective on SSL techniques and proposes a debiasing technique that can be viewed as decreasing the variance of the risk estimate. The authors argue that this leads to estimators that are better than the purely supervised estimator under a rather weak assumption called MCAR - which assumes that the probability of a missing label is independent of covariate and label. 

Although the exposition and perspective are interesting, this paper is borderline for the following two main reasons:

1. A few reviewers were not convinced of the theoretical result that is supposed to show that unlabeled data strictly helps - indeed, whereas usual variance reduction techniques (e.g for optimization schemes such as SGD etc.) lead to a strict gain in terms of convergence rate, there is no clear asymptotic/high probability statement that indicates statistical gain of the corresponding estimator (which is what we really care about - not the risk estimate). The dependence of lambda_opt on theta (which changes every iteration) does not help in providing such a statement. Since this is the primary contribution of the paper, I would suggest the authors follow through with the analysis to show a gain for the actual estimator compared to the ""complete case"" (only using supervised data). 

On that note, the authors claimed in their rebuttal that they have added an asymptotic variance analysis in Appendix I, which indeed would have made a very valuable point - however, I could only find a copy-pasted version of Theorem 3.1. in Appendix I? Similarly, Appendix F does not seem to include the comparison between debasing using labeled and unlabeled data but instead contains the proof of Theorem 3.2. Perhaps the wrong revision was uploaded, but unfortunately, given the current version, this point is not adequately addressed.

2. If the experimental results were more extensive and conclusive, then the current theorem could have perhaps been alright as a mainly methodological contribution. However, as the authors note, extensive experiments require a lot of compute power - however, given the lack of the ultimate theorem, the methodology becomes the primary contribution and would thus require more experimental evidence as the reviewers asked for.
  
Addressing one of the above points would push the paper above the acceptance threshold which we hope the authors can pursue in their next submission.

137,"Meta Review: The paper presents a new means to learn sparse Choquet integral, using for instance classical L_1 penalization techniques. This research participates to a long trend of research aiming at learning preference functions in various settings (here, having only limited preferential information). 

All reviewers agree that the paper is well-written and the contribution nicely presented. Two main critics were done by the reviewers:

* The first is the potential significance of the research, i.e., that it addresses an actual real-world problem. After discussion and rebuttals, this critic appears to be of less importance

* The second (with which I would concur) is that the experimental part is limited in different ways. The main critics regarding those are as follows:
1. The authors only use synthetic data that mostly comply with their assumptions, thereby confirming that their approach is valid. THey do not really challenge it.
2. There is no realistic data sets used (which is very difficult to obtain in incremental preference learning, but less in passive preference learning).
3. There is also no real comparisons with other methods intending to learn value functions from observed preferences.

138,"This work presents a method to obtain slide level representations in computational pathology. The specific contributions of this work are a positive-negative-aware module (PNM) and a weakly-supervised cross-slide contrastive learning (WSCL) module and a loss to encourage intra-WSI local patch separation and inter-WSI global feature contrast. The idea is to use the attention weights in a MIL framework as patch level pseudo labels. These are used to compute ""weights"" for positive and negative patches (the latter of which is assumed to be significantly larger in number for a given WSI). By using these weights in a contrastive manner to push the representations from positive patches away from those of negative patches, the model learns more effectively since it is less susceptible to the noise from the negative patches.

The reviewers found these contributions novel. During the review, the largest source of concern was along the choices made during the empirical evaluation. Specifically, the manuscript in its current form lacked empirical backing for several of the choices made regarding the neural architecture, the algorithm for self-supervised learning etc. In response to this the authors conducted several different kinds of ablation studies (which were incorporated into the supplement) during the rebuttal process, which other reviewers found convincing as a potential explanation of the outcomes.

Overall, I found the main contributions of this work (leveraging patch level attention weights as psuedo labels) to be an interesting use case for computational pathology to better focus the learning signal on positive patches.

141,"The paper describes a genetic algorithm for molecular optimization under constraints. The aim is to generate molecules with better properties while close to an initial lead molecule. The proposed approach is a two-stage one. The first stage aims to satisfy constraints and searches for feasible molecules that are similar to the lead.

- Comprehensive related work section.

Weaknesses:

- Lack of novelty because it is a standard application of genetic algorithm.
- The results show that the proposed method did not outperform existing baselines.
- The main claim of the paper (benefit of two-stage procedure) is not supported by ablation study.

However, the reviewers are mainly concerned with both the algorithmic novelty and experiments of the paper.

163,"This paper aims to study the convergence of deep neural networks training via a control theoretic analysis. This is a very interesting approach to establish theoretical understanding of deep learning. However, there are several concerns raised by the reviewers:

1.	The contribution of this paper is limited. The results simply follow from standard optimal control. It is not clear what new insight the paper provides.
2.	There are already quite a few works on control theoretic analysis of deep learning. This paper did not do a good job on presenting its novelty and difference with existing works.
3.	The experimental part is weak. It only involves small data set and very simple networks.

Using this dataset, the authors rigorously investigate the performance of beta-VAEs in this setting under a number of conditions, finding that weak supervision is necessary to induce disentangled representations, and that, perhaps surprisingly, disentanglement does not help for sim2real settings despite the similarity between the simulator and the real data. Reviewers were divided on the work, but had a number of concerns related to the claims of novel architecture, comparisons to baselines, and issues with the clarity of the paper, some of which were addressed in the authors' response. I agree with some of these concerns, particularly with respect to the claims of novel architectures since the modifications could simply be viewed as tweaking hyperparameters and are not rigorously compared to baselines. However, I think the novelty of the dataset and the rigorous evaluation of OOD generalization settings is likely to be valuable enough to the community to merit acceptance.

168,"The work proposes a continuous-time generalization of diffusion models on a discrete space. The description uses continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), in parallel to the existing stochastic differential equation description for continuous space. Reverse CTMC and modeling and ELBO objective are described. Some practical considerations and inspirations are also discussed, including avoiding exponentially large model in high dimensions, efficient reverse (generation) process simulation, and a corrector technique that further exploit the model to improve simulation (generation) quality. An error bound on the learned data distribution is also presented that shows a mild dependency on data dimensionality.

All the reviewers agree that this work presents the very right way to describe the continuous-time version of diffusion model on discrete space, and thereafter inspired techniques make a desired contribution to the community. Some concerns are raised, including still inferior performance than the continuous counterpart, and on the independence among dimensions. The authors provide reasonable remarks on them. Hence, I recommend accept to this paper.

One minor point: In Sec. 4.2, it would be clearer if the independence is specified both among the random variables $x^{1:D}$ in “output” and between each $x^d$ in “output” and $x^{1:D\backslash d}$ in “input”. Conventionally independence refers to the former, in which case the size is only reduced to $S^D \times D S^2$.

170,"This paper proposes an OOD evaluation framework under three categories: irrelevant input detection, novel class detection, and domain shift detection. As with several reviewers, the AC recognizes the importance and effort to distinguish between different cases of OOD detection, as well as the amount of experimental comparison across several prominent methods in literature (MSP, MC-dropout, cosine similarity, ODIN, Mahalanobis).  

Despite being well-motivated, three knowledgeable reviewers find the paper not ready yet for publication at ICLR. The AC recommends a rejection, given the standing major concerns from the reviewers. The AC is hopeful that the paper can be significantly improved by 

- sufficiently discussing and highlighting the novel insights of the results. 
- a more rigorous definition of  ""novel"" vs. ""irrelevant"" inputs. There seem to be overlapping definitions between what Hsu et al. considered vs. this paper. In particular,  Hsu et al distinguish i) samples of a novel class but in a known domain, called semantic shift (S), and ii) samples of known class in a novel domain, called non-semantic shift (NS), both of which are reconsidered in this paper. Therefore, the novelty of this submission is more precisely to distinguish within the category of semantic shift. The AC agrees that this might deem some more rigorous measurement and definition of ""semantic closeness"". 
- The AC also finds the evaluation of domain shift in Section 3.3.2 may be potentially misleading the community, as it falls out of the standard OOD scope. The notion of common corruption is closer to the robustness problem (which is how ML model predictions changes w.r.t some delta changes in the input space).

176,"This paper advances the long running thread of sequence modelling research focussed on differentiable instantiations of stack based models. In particular it builds upon recent work on the Nondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN) by introducing three extensions. The first is to relax the need for a normalised distribution over the state and action distribution and allow unnormalised weights, this mostly serves to facilitate gradient flow and thus easier training. The second extension allows the RNN to condition on the top stack state as well as the symbol, improving expressiveness. The third improvement introduces a method for limiting the memory required to run the proposed model on long sequences, thus allowing its application to practical language modelling tasks. Each of these requires substantial algorithmic innovations.

The reviewers all agree that this is a strong paper worthy of publication. The paper includes a useful review of previous differentiable stack models which nicely sets up the rest of the paper where the contributions are well motivated and clearly presented. The reviewers had a number of clarification questions, partly due to the author's use of overly concise citations for key algorithms rather than inline descriptions. This situation has been improved by updates made to the paper.
The evaluation includes a series of synthetic experiments which are clear and provide a good elucidation of the various stack models properties. The practical evaluation on language modelling is more limited and serves mostly to demonstrate that the nondeterministic model can be scaled to a basic language modelling task.

Overall this is a strong paper with a well motivated and clear hypothesis. It provides a substantial extension to the prior work on nondeterministic stack models and progresses this line of research toward practical applications.

In addition to the review comments, a few comments of my own:

- Equation (2) assumes that the SDE is solved via the Euler--Maruyama method. Whilst analytically convenient, I believe it is more elegant to treat the general case for as long as possible (without reducing to just the EM method at this early stage). If the noise has particular structure then it may become desirable to solve the SDE via some more efficient numerical method, e.g. Milstein if using commutative noise or Heun if using additive noise (Heun converges to the Stratonovich solution, but for additive noise then Itô and Stratonovich are identical).
- I think equation (2) may be missing a $t_{n+1}-t_n$ coefficient for the $f$ term.
- The ""not too far"" of line 67 is usually referred to as a ""trust region"".

Based on th fact that the conferred unlearnability is found fragile to adversarial training, the authors design new methods to generate robust unlearnable examples that are protected from adversarial training. In addition, considering the vulnerability of error-minimizing noise in adversarial training, robust error-minimizing noise is then introduced to reduce the adversarial training loss.
The authors have tried to respond to reviewers' comments along with adding more experiments.
Overall, this manuscript finally gets three positive reviews and one negative review, where the possible vulnerability or robustness of error-minimizing noise against (simple) image processing operations was not verified.
In comparison with other manuscripts I'm handling that got consistent positive comments, this manuscript is still recommended to be accepted (poster) with a further study of robustness under simple image transformations in the final version.

185,"The reviewers carefully analyzed this work and agreed that the topics investigated in this paper are important and relevant to the field. Overall, the reviewers had a generally positive impression of this paper. One reviewer argued that this paper addresses a relevant and valuable question and makes an important step towards a better understanding of regret when reward shaping is used. Even though this paper makes assumptions that were of some concern to other reviewers, this reviewer argued that the paper is nonetheless an important milestone for the community. Another reviewer acknowledged that this paper conducted a formal theoretical investigation of the impact of reward shaping methods on the sample complexity of RL algorithms and argued that all proofs seem to be sound. This reviewer had a few technical questions, which were all addressed by the authors. Post-rebuttal, the reviewer encouraged the authors to incorporate the corresponding details (such as those discussed in the rebuttal) in the updated version of their draft. A third reviewer emphasized that this paper shed light on reward shaping from a theoretical perspective. They argued that the quality and scientific soundness of the paper are objectively excellent, that the paper is original, and that it deserves merit. The reviewer pointed out one main weakness, however, regarding the assumption of the type of the shaped reward function. They wondered whether this assumption could limit the impact and applicability of the paper's results. After reading the authors' thorough rebuttal, however, the reviewer stated that they were satisfied with all responses and updated their score accordingly. Finally, a fourth reviewer also had an overall positive view of this work but pointed out, as a weakness, the seemingly strong assumption that the shaping signal is an approximation of the optimal value function. After reading the authors' response, however, the reviewer stated that the assumptions made in this paper were not as restrictive as they initially thought, and updated their score. Overall, thus, it seems like most reviewers were positively impressed with the quality of this work. They look forward to an updated paper version addressing the suggestions mentioned in their reviews and during the discussion phase.

an algorithm with query complexity scaling near-linearly in the dimension. Using only iid samples, one would need exponential dependence on dimension. The algorithm is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

199,"Executive summary:

The authors study the repeated allocation of an identical good over T rounds to n strategic buyers in a ""no monetary transfers"" setting. The buyers have i.i.d. valuations drawn from an unknown distribution, and the algorithm must work with reported valuations. The goal is to maximize social welfare (= sum of valuations) under the constraint that each buyer receives a pre-specified fraction of the total number of goods. 

The main result is an algorithm for this problem that ensures two things: 

(a) approximate Bayesian incentive compatibility (approx-BIC) (Definition 2 and Theorem 1) and 

(b) low individual regret (Definition 3 and Theorem 2). 

The key idea of the algorithm (is to exploit the iid-ness of the problem) and detect misreports from the underlying CDF using Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz type bounds.

Discussion and recommendation:

After some initial set back on the problem motivation, the reviewers bought into the motivation for studying this online allocation problem ""without monetary transfers"" (adding examples such as the foodbank example might be good).  

There was some discussion around ""assuming iid valuations"" limiting the generality of the result, but there is in fact a history of papers that studies learning with strategic agents under this assumption (eg Kanoria and Nazerzadeh 2021).

The main difference of the current work is that it's working in a setting without money.

The idea behind the algorithm is maybe ""the obvious think to do"" - but of course it still requires some work to formally prove that it actually works. 

I think one thing that could strengthen the paper would be to add some discussion around the tightness/non-tightness of the approximate BIC and individual regret bounds.

Weak accept.

Nevertheless, the reviewers found the paper interesting enough to recommend a weak accept and I support that recommendation.

From a reviewers lens, I was a little surprised that the paper made no mention of prior works on maximizing mutual information between features of neural networks to improve results. As an example, see the following paper [1] that uses a mutual information regularizer between states at different steps of a recurrent neural networks. There is also a rich literature of doing so for convolutional neural networks. It would have made sense to compare how the idea in the paper performed in comparison to these methods (and in a sense the ablation study which looked at randomly choosing time steps, k, (regardless of the uncertainty estimator) is an experiment in this direction). I understand that part of the paper deals with the choice of time points to increase mutual information between, and so its probably more efficient than the other alternatives, but a comparison (or discussion in related works) would have made the paper stronger.

228,"Overall, all reviewers see the novelty in the dataset that provides an original new set of tactile data, accounting for a wide range of objects and scene, collected in the wild. The paper is overall well written, clear and easy to follow, and provides a good demonstration of the importance and usefulness of the dataset, going beyond datasets collected by robots in the context of material properties. It also includes initial steps towards benchmarking, although it is not the core contribution of the paper, which lies in the creation of the dataset itself. 

Two reviewers recommend acceptance, two stand marginally below acceptance, and one does recommend rejection. The authors have provided detailed responses to all reviewers’ comments and concerns and updated their manuscript. The main concerns of those reviewers sitting on the fence seem to be answered and limitations acknowledged however the element of bias in the data collection was still considered as a possible concern. Based on my reading and accounting for the authors changes, there approach itself is novel and original and hence provides already a relevant contribution to NeuroIPS; while the authors acknowledge limitations and future work avenues. The one reviewer recommending rejection didn’t engage in the discussion but from my reading of both the paper, the comments, and the authors responses, I believe the main points were addressed by the authors and misunderstandings clarified.

229,"The paper proposes to include a component enforcing logical constraints on top of a variational autoencoder (VAE). The resulting method, VAEL. does so by leveraging ProbLog in addition to a neural encoder and decoder. VAEL is employed for simple generative tasks with constraints over the outputs, such as conditional image generation with MNIST and small Mario levels.

The reviewers have appreciated the direction where VAEL is heading and the importance of integrating constraints in deep generative models. Some concerns are still open.

The complexity and scaling campabilities of performing symbolic reasoning with ProbLog are not discussed in depth.

230,"This paper presents Recommender Transformer (RETR) with a pathway attention mechanism that can dynamically zeroing-out the interactions (e.g., the trivial/noisy ones) in transformer-based sequential recommender systems. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. 

Overall this paper received mixed reviews with borderline scores. The reviewers raised concerns around baselines and evaluations, some of which the authors promptly addressed in the revision during the rebuttal period. I also read the paper in details myself. I do agree with some of the concerns from the reviewers but I don't think a method needs to beat every other published papers to be published (and I think the current baselines are more than thorough enough). My biggest complaint about the paper is around the writing, specifically, how the proposed idea is presented. 

This paper tries to tackle an important question, which is that in sequential recommendation, not every interactions are useful in helping predict future interaction. The self-attention mechanism in transformer kind of addresses this problem but in a more ""softer"" fashion with attention weights. This paper presents a simple yet effective method to introduce a pathway mechanism that adaptively zeroing-out some of the interactions via a binary pathway router. In order to train such a model end-to-end, Gumbel-softmax sampling is utilized.

The most important part of the contribution to me is that this is an improvement to the transformer architecture, as opposed to a new model which is what this paper's writing suggests -- the proposed approach is effectively model-agonistic and doesn't marry to a particular loss function or finer-grained architectural choices (number of layers, etc.). Currently there are many baselines in the paper, but each made some different model/architecture choices, which could contribute to the difference in performance (or not, but we wouldn't know). An ideal evaluation should have been to take all the transformer-based baselines that are currently in the paper, add this pathway mechanism without changing anything else, and show that the results improved over the transformer architecture. In this way, we know the improvements are exactly coming from introducing the pathway. The authors might argue some of the current results are already supporting this argument, but my point is to emphasize this point very explicitly rather than leaving it for the readers to infer. 

From what I read in this paper, I truly believe this pathway idea has its potential. Therefore, I would especially want the authors to further refine the presentation to better convey the idea, which in turn will hopefully increase the impact of this paper once it is eventually published. 

Some minor comments:
* The way the paper is currently written seems to suggest there are only three types of pathways and the network is capable of capturing all of them. I am personally not a big of fan of over-interpreting what a neural net is trying to do. Therefore, I wouldn't overly focus on the characterization of different pathways and only show the qualitative examples at the end as a high-level demonstration.
* In Eq 2 ""softmax"" should really be ""sigmoid"" if a 0-1 prediction is made there. Then the following line ""logit"" is probably not the right word here. 
* The qualitative examples at the end (figure 3) can be more carefully examined/labeled. For example, the current categorization is quite ambiguous -- ""Indie"" refers to the type of developers while ""JPG"" refers to the genre of the game, they are certainly not mutually exclusive.

232,"The reviewers have improved their scores after the rebuttal, and I agree that the work has value. It proposes a model-driven data augmentation approach to environment-invariant graph representation. Just like most data augmentation works in graph representation learning, the approach relies on graph proposal generator. The work has an implicit mechanism hidden in the graph generator (the authors' reply to a reviewer that ""we target the extrapolation via a new invariant learning approach that is agnostic to specific GNN models"" is a misunderstanding of why & how these types of methods work). The submission could significantly improve the introduction by properly describing the work w.r.t. other OOD efforts in graph representation learning. While the tasks of different works may be different (e.g., graph classification vs node classification), it is important to emphasize what each different approach brings to the table (rather than just state that the tasks are different). I hope the authors take this opportunity to improve the introduction. This work is more similar to the former OOD graph representation works than IRM & REX, since (without modeling assumptions) both IRM and REX require the support of the environments in test to be a subset of the ones in training. The present work does not need this support assumption since it uses an implicit mechanism in the graph generator.

The toy example in Section 3.1 is informative, thank you. The theory looks solid and easy to understand. The technical novelty is limited, since once the input graph has been decomposed into a set of ego-graphs the definitions, formulations, and theory are all straightforward adaptations from the respective versions for IID data.

242,"This paper presents a simple approach called PDM for composing non-linear and complex normalizing flows with score-based generative models. Since score-based models can be considered as a special form of continuous-time normalizing flows, PDM corresponds to a composition of different classes of normalizing flows. 

Pros: 
* Combining generic normalizing flows with score-based models is an interesting direction as they have different characteristics and can be complementary to each other.
* Using Ito's lemma to show that the model learns a non-linear SDE in data space is valuable. 
* The authors show that the variational gap can be reduced using normalizing flows.

Cons: 
* The proposed method does not exhibit a clear advantage compared to the diffusion baseline without the normalizing flow component. On the CIFAR10 dataset, the best NLL and FID results are obtained by the diffusion baseline.

* Theorem 2 makes a very unrealistic assumption that a flow network is flexible enough to transform $p_r$ to any arbitrary distribution. If this holds, we wouldn't need the score-based generation model anymore. We could simply train the normalizing flow to map the input data distribution to a Normal distribution.

* This submission chooses to discuss differences with the recent LSGM framework. However, in doing so, several inaccurate claims are made. The lack of inference data diffusion in LSGM is mentioned as one of its drawbacks. However, it is not clear what is the value of having such a mechanism and what implications it may have on the expressivity of the model. Note that mapping from data space to latent space in VAEs can be considered as a stochastic inversion rather than an exact inversion. Ito's lemma does not require invertibility and it can be easily applied to the forward and generative diffusion in LSGM. The authors argue that applying it to the forward diffusion in LSGM will result in $\hat{p_{r}}\ne p_{r}$. But, $\hat{p_{r}}$ would be only considered for visualization of the forward diffusion and it is not used for training or any other purposes. LSGM, the proposed PDM, and score-based models are all trained with a reweighting of ELBO (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02808)). It is not clear if the drawback mentioned above has an impact on the training or expressivity of the model.

* The presentation in the paper requires improvement. The motivation on why invertibility plays a key role is not clear beyond generating the visualization in Figure 2. 

In summary, the paper proposes an interesting idea and explores directions very relevant to the current focus in generative learning. However, given the concerns above, we don't believe that the paper in its current form is ready for presentation at ICLR.

248,"This paper proposes a method to resolve ""language drift,"" where a pre-trained X->language model trained in an X->language->Y pipeline drifts away from being natural language. In particular, it proposes to add an auxiliary training objective that performs grounding with multimodal input to fix this problem. Results are good on a task where translation is done between two languages.

The main concern that was raised with this paper by most of the reviewers is the validity of the proposed task itself. Even after extensive discussion with the authors, it is not clear that there is a very convincing scenario where we both have a pre-trained X->language, care about the intermediate results, and have some sort of grounded input to fix this drift. While I do understand the MT task is supposed to be a testbed for the true objective, it feel it is necessary to additionally have one convincing use case where this is a real problem and not just the artificially contrived. This use case could either be of practical use (e.g. potentially useful in an application), or of interest from the point of view of cognitive plausibility (e.g. similar to how children actually learn, and inspired by cognitive science literature).

A concern that offshoots from this is that because the underlying idea is compelling (some sort of grounding to inform language learning), a paper at a high-profile conference such as ICLR may help re-popularize this line of research, which has been a niche for a while. Normally I would say this is definitely a good thing; I think considering grounding in language learning is definitely an important research direction, and have been a fan of this line of work since reading Roy's seminal work on it from 15 years ago. However, if the task used in this paper, which is of questionable value and reality, becomes the benchmark for this line of work I think this might lead other follow-up work in the wrong direction.  I feel that this is a critical issue, and the paper will be much stronger after a more realistic task setting is added.

Thus, I am not recommending acceptance at this time, but would definitely like the authors to think hard and carefully about a good and realistic benchmark for the task, and follow up with a revised version of the paper in the future.

262,"This paper treats the problem of running gradient descent-ascent (GDA) in min-max games with a different step-size for the two players. Earlier work by Jin et al. has shown that, when the ratio of the step-sizes is large enough, the stable fixed points of GDA coincide with the game's strict local min-max equilibria. The main contribution of this paper is an explicit characterization of a threshold value $\tau^*$ of this ratio as the maximum eigenvalue of a specific matrix that involves the second derivatives of the game's min-max objective at each (strict local) equilibrium.

This paper generated a fairly intense discussion, and the reviewers showed extraordinary diligence in assessing the authors' work. Specifically, the reviewers raised a fair number of concerns concerning the initial write-up of the paper, but these concerns were mostly addressed by the authors in their revision and replies. As a result, all reviewers are now in favor of acceptance.

After my own reading of both versions of the paper and the corresponding discussion, I concur with the reviewers' view and I am recommending acceptance subject to the following revisions for the final version of the paper:
1. Follow the explicit recommendations of AnonReviewer3 regarding the numerical simulations (or, failing that, remove them altogether). [The authors' phrase that ""The theory we provide also does not strictly apply to using RMSprop"" does not suffice in this regard]
2. Avoid vague statements like $\tau \to \infty$ in the introduction regarding the work of Jin et al. and state precisely their contributions in this context. In the current version of the paper, a version of this is done in page 4, but the introduction is painting a different picture, so this discussion should be transferred there.
3. A persisting concern is that the authors' characterization of $\tau^*$ cannot inform a practical choice of step-size scaling (because the value of $\tau^*$ derived by the authors depends on quantities that cannot be known to the optimizer). Neither the reviewers nor myself were particularly convinced by the authors' reply on this point. However, this can also be seen as an ""equilibrium refinement"" result, i.e., for a given value of $\tau$ only certain equilibria can be stable. I believe this can be of interest to the community, even though the authors' characterization cannot directly inform the choice of $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ (or their ratio).

Although the experimental results are solid and technically sound, the novelty of the methodology is not enough, as the domain classifier and the gradient reversal layer are the same with those methods in domain adaptation such as ""unsupervised domain adaptation by backpropagation"". On the other hand, more recent SOTA methods are missing and only smaller scale datasets are used for evaluation. During the discussions, the major concerns from three reviewers are novelty. 

I totally agree that the simplicity of the method should be a virtue. However, the idea of domain-invariant representation learning is already established well, and its application to adversarial training is quite intuitive to the community. Also, the similar methodology already exists in domain adaptation. According to the top-tier conference culture in the ML community, what most valuable is the novelty and insight, not the performance. In the end, I think that this paper may not be ready for publication at ICLR, but the next version must be a strong paper.

271,"The paper proposes a new pipeline-parallel training method called WPipe. WPipe works (on a very high level) by replacing the two-buffer structure of PipeDream-2BW with a two-partition-group structure, allowing resources to be shared in a similar way to PipeDream-2BW but with less memory use and less delays in weight update propagation across stages. The 1.4x speedup it achieves over PipeDream-2BW is impressive.

In discussion, the reviewers agreed that the problem WPipe tries to tackle is important and that the approach is novel and interesting. But there was significant disagreement among the reviewers as to score. A reviewer expressed concern about the work being incremental and difficult to follow. And while these were valid concerns, and the authors should take note of them when revising their paper, I do not think they should present a bar to publication, both based on my own read of the work and also in light of the fact that other reviewers with higher confidence scores did not find novelty to be a disqualifying concern.

272,"The paper introduces model-agnostic ways of quantifying predictive uncertainty and latent space differences in the situation when the distribution of data encountered during deployment differs from what the system was trained on and there is no access to the data itself. The model is evaluated on large scale EEG data.

The paper solves an important problem, in particular to the field of healthcare which has previously seen instances of models underperforming significantly at the time of deployment. As mentioned by the reviewers, this direction has not been sufficiently explored, so there is novelty in the problem itself, as well as in the solution. The experiments on EEG data were seen as convincing by the reviewers, though some questions were raised about the scope of the paper.

Overall, there is considerable merit in the work and recommend acceptance of this paper. In the camera ready, the authors should make sure not to overstate the applicability of their method. While this work could, in theory, be applied (or adapted) to other data, the merits of it outside of models trained on EEG data have not been demonstrated and should therefore not be stated as a given.

273,"This manuscript proposes and analyses a bucketing method for Byzantine-robustness in non-iid federated learning. The manuscript shows how existing Byzantine-robust methods suffer vulnerabilities when the devices are non-iid, and describe a simple coordinated attack that defeats many existing defenses. In response, the primary algorithmic contribution is a bucketing approach that aggregates subgroups of devices before robust aggregation. This approach is also easily composed with existing Byzantine-robust methods. The manuscript includes an analysis of the performance of the proposed approach, including an information-theoretic lower bound for certain settings.

During the review, the main concerns are related to the clarity of the technical contributions, and unclear technical statements.

275,"The paper considers model-based RL, and focuses on approaches that benefit from the differentiability of the model in order to compute the policy gradient. It theoretically shows that the error in the gradient of the model w.r.t. its input appears in an upper bound of the error in the policy gradient computing using the learned model. Motivated by this, it suggests a MBRL approach that learns two models, one of them minimizes the next-state prediction error (as commonly done) and the other minimizes a combination of prediction error and the gradient error. 
The paper empirically studies the method through extensive experiments.

Reviewers are generally positive about this work. They believe that the paper is insightful and the method is original. At first, there were some important concerns raised by the reviewers, but the authors revised their paper in the discussion period, and it appears that the reviewers are all satisfied now. I also read the paper during the rebuttal phase, and I should say that I have some concerns myself, especially on the theory part of the paper. Given that the authors did not have an opportunity to answer my questions, I do not put much weight on my concerns (and I believe most of them can be addressed with some clarifications). Considering the positive response of reviewers and promising results, I am going to recommend **acceptance** of this paper.

I strongly encourage the authors to consider the comments by reviewers, as well as the following ones, in the revision of their paper.


**Comments**

1) The true dynamics $f$ is defined as a stochastic one, i.e., $s_{t+1} = f(s_t, a_t, \epsilon_t)$ (just before Eq. 1), and similarly for the learned model. Here $\epsilon_t$ is the noise causing the stochasticity of the model. But later, when the errors on the model and its gradient are introduced (i.e., $\epsilon_f$ and $\epsilon_f^g$), the role of stochasticity becomes unclear.
For example, we have
$\|| \tilde{f}(s,a) - f(s,a) \||  \leq \epsilon_f$.

What happened to the noise term?

The same is true for Eq. (5). The next-state s' (either according to the true dynamics or the learned model) is random. In that case, it is not obvious how to interpret Eq. (5). Is it the error of the expected gradient of the next state? Or is it something else?

In case the dynamics is assumed to be deterministic, this should be clarified early in the paper.

2) The upper bound in Theorem 1 might be vacuous if the Lipschitz constant $L_f$ of the model is larger than 1.
To see this, consider Lemma 1. The constant $C_0$ is $\min [D/\epsilon_f, (1-L_f^{t+1})/(1 - L_f)]$.
If $L_f$ is larger than 1, for large enough t, the term $(1-L_f^{t+1})/(1 - L_f)$ blows up and $C_0$ becomes $D/\epsilon_f$. Therefore, the upper bound of Lemma 1 becomes $D$. Here $D$ is the diameter of the state space, which is assumed to be bounded.

This carries to in the next lemmas. In Lemma 4, $C_5$ would be of the same order as $C_0$ (multiplied by an extra $L_1 L_f / (1 - \gamma) )$, so the upper bound of this lemma becomes proportional to D too.

The $C_0$'s appearance continues in the proof of Theorem 1, in which $C_8$ is proportional to $C_0$ and $C_5$. So, $C_8$ is also become proportional to $D/\epsilon_f$. When we have $C_8 \epsilon_f$ in Eq. (34), we get a constant term $D$.
A similar dependence appears in the proof of Theorem 2, where B_3 is proportional to $C_8 \epsilon_f$, which can be as large as $D$. And in Eq. (47), we have $B_3^2$. So the upper bound in Eq. (47), which seems to the be upper bound of Theorem 2, is proportional to $D^2$. This means that if $L_f$ is larger than one, the upper bound does not go to zero, no matter how small the model error $\epsilon_f$ is (unless it is actually zero). This makes the bound meaningless.

This might be unavoidable. I am not sure about it at the moment. But it definitely requires a discussion.

3) Assumption 2 has a term in the form of $E[\frac{s_{t_2}}{ s_{t_1}} ]$ (I have simplified the form). The states $s_{t_2}$ and $s_{t_1}$ are vectors in general. How is the division defined here?

4) Please improve the clarify of the proofs. For example, in Lemma 2 it seems that a negative sign is missing in Eq. (49). Also how do we get Eq. (50) and Eq. (52)? (I couldn't easily verify them).

5) I believe the ""periodicity property"" used in Assumption 1 should be ""ergodicity property"".

6) The paper still has a lot of typos, e.g., ""To optimize the objective, One can ..."" (P3), ""argument data"" (instead of augmented) (p4), ""Superpose"" (p5), ""funcrion"" (p6).

285,"This paper builds on a promising line of literature developing connections between Gaussian processes and deep neural networks.  Viewing one model under the lens of (the infinite limit of) another can lead to neat new insights and algorithms.  In this case the authors develop a connection between convolutional networks and Gaussian processes with a particular kind of kernel.

The reviewers all believed the paper had contributions which would be interesting to the community (such as R1: ""the paper presents a novel efficient way to compute the convolutional kernel, which I believe has merits on its own"" and R2: ""I really like the idea of authors that kernels based on convolutional networks might be more practical compared to the ones based on fully connected networks"").  All the reviewers found the contribution of the covariance function to be novel and exciting.

Some cited weaknesses of the paper were that the authors didn't analyze the uncertainty from the model (arguably the reasoning for adopting a Bayesian treatment), novelty in appealing to the central limit theorem to arrive at the connection, and scalability of the model.

290,"The paper presents a multi-granularity input represenaion and a pyramid attention mechanism for code summarizaiton tasks. After extensive discussion, the reviewers still cannot agree on accepting or rejecting this paper. The key discussion points and my opinion are summarized in below. 


1. Performance improvement -- a few reviewers point out the performance improvement is relatively small (about 1%) compared with baseline. With the additional error bar provided by the authors, it seems to me the improvement is statistically significant. The authors also provide sufficient ablation study to justify the improvement. Although it's arguable if the proposed appracoh is substantial, the progress of AI is often driven by incremental improvement in terms of performance. Therefore, I'm less concerned by this issue. 

2. Comparison only on 1 language and 2 datasets. I partially agree with the authors and reviwers Xtyo that the paper already conducted extensive experiments and the merits of the proposed approach are justified. However, I disagree with the attritue that the comparison on 1 language is sufficient given the recent progress of code summariziton. As the proposed approach is mainly justified by empirical comparison, conducting results on a limited dataset raises the concern whether the proposed approach is generalizble to other languages and datasets. It also makes future work harder to compare with this work. I especially disagree the point that some earlier papers only compared on limited datasets. These papers are published earlier than the benchmark CodeXGlue has been released. As most recent baselines are compared on CodeXGlue, there is a need to justify the missing of results on this dataset. Besides, the argument of the dataet is noisy the performance is low do not seem rigorous and reasonable to me.

3. Human evaluation. The authors provide a preliminary study of human evaluation on the generated outputs. On one hand, it shows the proposed approach indeed improve the quality of the summary, but on the other hand, the study requires more rigorous design. I would suggest including the human evaluation on the main text rather than in appendix. 

4. Presentation. The paper is mostly well-written and provide nice intuition behind the propose method. However, I also agree with Q2Zz that some statements might overclaim and require justification. The later part of the paper has significant number of typos and require a careful proofread. It's pity that the authors do not take the opportunity during the rebuttal period to revise the paper.

Overall, I think the paper has sufficient merits but still have room to improve.

292,"The authors analyze the latent representation of visual features from natural movies in the salamander retina using a U-net. They train an encoder to learn a compressed latent representation from a large population of salamander retinal ganglion cells responding to natural movies, while a decoder samples from this compressed latent space to generate the appropriate movie frame. They characterize its representation of “time in the natural scene” in the latent space of their model.

Overall, the reviewers expressed a lot of interest in the topic and valued the novel application to salamander retinal data. There were some questions about the significance of the finding, and through the rebuttal period, the authors provided a number of experiments to compare against other variants of their baselines (and ablations), with some reviewers increasing their scores in favor of acceptance. 

At the same time, there was concern that the U-Net architecture could potentially reconstruct the movie without any retinal data. Thus, it was not entirely clear whether the model was truly leveraging the retinal data to obtain meaningful outputs. Unfortunately, this concern was not fully addressed in the revision, leaving the reviewers overall with mixed views but the majority in favor of acceptance.

297,"The paper gives an extension of the transformer model that is suited to computing representations of source code. The main difference from transformers is that the model takes in a program's abstract syntax tree (AST) in addition to its sequence representation, and utilizes several pairwise distance measures between AST nodes in the self-attention operation. The model is evaluated on the task of code summarization for 5 different languages and shown to beat two state-of-the-art models. One interesting observation is that a model trained on data from all languages outperforms the monolingual version of the model.

The reviewers generally liked the paper. The technical idea is simple, but the evaluation is substantial and makes a convincing case about setting a new state of the art.

300,"In this paper, the authors tackle the problem of demonstrators and learners having different observation spaces, by proposing an importance-weighted learning algorithm to bring the support of the imitator state marginal closer to that of the expert demonstrator's state marginal. 

All reviewers have voted to weak accept, but it would seem that this year's NeurIPS mechanism of reviewer assignment has resulted in a much higher acceptance rate than typical, with 80%+ of the AC batch having accept votes. As such, I am tasked with the tough job of rejecting some papers that reviewers were only lukewarmly excited about. It pains me to do this to a paper that reviewers have found methodologically correct. I will be recommending this paper be rejected based on calibration against other papers I'm AC'ing, mostly for the following reason:

The HOIL paper assumes a problem setting where:

1. expert observations with more privilege observations than learner: 
2. access to expert observations being high cost and invasive 
3. importance-weighting the data to close the support between learner and expert state distributions mitigates (1) and (2)

However, it's not demonstrated that (1) and (2) is an actual problem in practical applications. Is sensor mismatch between human and autonomous vehicles the actual problem for learning? Do self-driving cars even utilize a policy formulation explored in the HOIL paper? How big are these state / support mismatches in practice, and couldn't they be mitigated by simpler methods? This paper is the first I've heard suggested that sensor mismatch between humans and autonomous vehicle sensors is the bottleneck for performance. If we remove this motivation from the paper and only consider the importance weighting algorithm used for removing out of distribution examples, then it doesn't feel quite as novel as there are many works that propose some kind of distribution-projection step as a way to mitigate state marginal differences between teachers and learners (e.g. CQL). 

In fact, the setting (1) is not only avoided, but actively exploited by some learning papers (Asymmetric Actor Critic, Guided Policy Search, and other ideas) to *boost* the sample efficiency of learning, with the idea that the asymmetry in state support allows experts to provide useful learning signal in a way that the learner cannot adversarially overfit easily. 

From reviewer pD56,

I didn't find the authors' response to be particularly convincing (the self-driving example doesn't seem like a good fit for what they're doing, and I think they're conflating differences in perceptual accuracy with differences in sensing hardware).

304,"## Description
The paper discovers interesting phenomena in training neural networks with binary weights:
- Connection between latent weight magnitude and how important its binarized version for the network performance
-training dynamics, indicating that large latent weights are identified and stabilize early on
- Observation that amongst learned binary kernel, several specific patterns prevail, up to the bits who's reversal has very little effect. This is so regardless of the architecture, the layer considered or the dataset. 
The paper further demonstrates how these observations may be used to compress binary neural networks below 1 bit per weight.

## Review Process and Decision
The reviewers welcomed the experimental investigation of new phenomena, but commented the overall technical quality of the work as somewhat substandard. The redundancy of consecutive affine transforms is known and not connected to binary weights investigation. The investigation itself lacks a more in-depth analysis. The proposed compression results appeared not convincing to reviewers since a significant drop of accuracy occurs. The AC shares these concerns and supports rejection.

## General Comments
From my perspective, the study undertaken is methodologically „wrong“. An ad-hoc training method is investigated, which is not even clearly defined in the paper (there are many „STE“ variants) and for which it is not known what it is doing, what are the real-valued weights for and whether they are needed at all (as empirically argued by Helwegen et al. (2019)). As such, the investigation makes impression of poking a black box (the training method in this case). At the same time, there are more clear learning formulations, applicable in the setting of the paper (binary weights), in particular considering the stochastic relaxation:
* Shayer et al. (2017): Learning Discrete Weights Using the Local Reparameterization Trick
* Roth et al. (2019): Training Discrete-Valued Neural Networks with Sign Activations Using Weight Distributions
* Peters et al. (2018): Probabilistic binary neural networks

These methods are approximate, but at least the optimization is well posed and it is known what do the real-valued weights represent (e.g. logits of binary weight probabilities).
From this perspective, it can be seen that latent weights close to 0 correspond to Bernoulli weights that are almost fully random (and thus only contribute noise) and are fragile to gradient steps. Therefore the model can only perform well if it learns to be robust to their state or their state becomes more deterministic (corresponding to large latent weight). So one would actually expect to see in these models phenomena similar to the observed in the paper and not bee too much surprised or astonished by them. Furthermore, there are recent works explaining STE and its latent weights as optimizing the stochastic relaxation:
* Meng et al. (2020): Training Binary Neural Networks using the Bayesian Learning Rule
* Yanush et al. (2020): Reintroducing Straight-Through Estimators as Principled Methods for Stochastic Binary Networks. 

The authors are encouraged to make the observed phenomena more explainable by connecting to the mentioned works.

## Further Details

*  „We show that in the context of using batch normalization after convolutional layers, adapting scaling factors with either hand-crafted or learnable methods brings marginal or no accuracy gain to final model.“

From theoretical perspective, this is obvious and known to me. Practically, there could be in principle some difference due to the learning dynamics, and verifying that there is none is a useful but a weak contribution. The section devoted to this issue can be given in the appendix but is not justified in the main paper.

* „change of weight signs is crucial in the training of BWNs“

The sign determines the binary weights, so this is by definition.

* „ Firstly, the training of BWNs demonstrates the process of seeking primary binary sub-networks whose weight signs are determined and fixed at the early training stage, which is akin to recent findings on the lottery ticket hypothesis for efficient learning of sparse neural networks“

In the lottery ticket hypothesis paper it is shown explicitly that the identified sparse subnetwork changes during the learning the most rather than retains its initialization state or the state in the beginning of the training. It is therefore could be of a different nature.


","This paper provides an empirical study of binary weight networks (BWNs), where they find that 1 the commonly adopted scaling factor is not critical .

The paper presents a method of training two-level hierarchies that is based on relatively intuitive ideas and that performs well.
The challenges of hierarchical RL makes this an important problem. The benefits of periodicity and the
separation of internal state from external state is a clean principle that can potentially be broadly employed. 
The method does well in outperforming the alternative baselines.

Weaknesses

There is no video of the results. There is related work, i.e., [Peng et al. 2016] (rev 4) uses 
a policy ensemble;  phase info is used in DeepLoco/DeepMimic; methods such as ""Virtual Windup Toys for Animation"" 
exploited periodicity (25y ago);  More comparisons with prior work such as Florensa et al. would help. 
The separation of internal and external state is an assumption that may not hold in many cases.
The results are locomotion focussed. There are only two timescales.

Decision

The reviewers are largely in agreement to accept the paper. 
There are fairly-simple-but-useful lessons to be found in the paper
for those working on HRL problems, particularly those for movement and locomotion. 
The AC sees the novely with respect to different pieces of related work is the weakest point of the paper.  
The reviews contain good suggestions for revisions and improvements;  the latest version may take care
of these (uploaded after the last reviewer comments). Overall, the paper will make a good contribution
to ICLR 2019.


","This paper proposes a method to train high- and low-level controllers to tackle hierarchical RL .

After a thorough discussion phase, all the reviewers are on the positive side of this paper. The reviewers appreciated the novelty of this paper and the importance of scaling neural combinatorial optimization for large-scale instances. Overall, I recommend acceptance for this paper.

However, the reviewers also showed concerns about the presentation of this paper. The gap between generalization and testing performance is not clearly discussed and the connection to prior works using continuous latent space should be clearly stated. Since scalability is an important issue, it would be useful to clear up time/objective comparison and unify experimental settings as suggested by Reviewer fQdp and fe3B.

310,"This paper proposes improving human interpretability and manipulability of neural representations by obtaining syntactic roles (here, subject, object, prepositional object, and main verb) without supervision by means of them becoming linked to latent variables in a novel proposed attention-driven VAE (ADVAE) model, which provides cross attention between a language transformer and latent variables. The paper argues that syntactic roles are quite central to meaning interpretation and that the ADVAE recovers them better than LSTM or Transformer (with mean pooling) VAEs.

This is a quite interesting direction and paper. There was active discussion with the reviewers, one of whom (9pDc) moved their rating from reject to quite strong support, while the other reviewers either sat on the fence or raised from reject to borderline. Nevertheless, I overall tend to agree that the paper is still lacking in empirical support, a view clearly shared by reviewers WuPD and 7uFL. The SNLI data is very simple descriptive sentences, nearly all in the form of S V O or S V PP. Would this work on more complex data, in other languages, or with more word order variation? There isn't very much investigation, but the new results added during reviewing based on Yelp data seem to offer more concerns than confidence. These are also very short sentences but with more varied structure and some complementation. It seems like D_{dec} is now very low (much lower than for the sequence VAE), the ability to distinguish out grammatical roles seems limited to {subj} vs. {dobj, pobj} in the encoder and none at all in the decoder (Figure 6/7). And then for the examples in Appendix D, the disentanglement abilities barely seem stronger than being able to pick out subjects, though when there are sentences with subordinate clauses, it is perhaps random which subject you get. The resampled realizations in appendix H also seem to show limited disentanglement: resampling the subject usually seems to change the object as well, often markedly. No convincing downstream applications are shown. As such, while I agree that disentanglement is at the heart of representation learning, I can't get on board with reviewer 9pDc feeling that this paper now has convincing results. Reviewer 7uFL also emphasizes that there is no strong reason that the latent variables have to align with syntactic roles. In particular, the motivation in NMT whereby constituents clump and reorder together does not exist here. It may only work for the very simple and regular sentences of SNLI.

Hence, overall, I feel that this method needs more extensive validation on harder, more varied data sets before it becomes a convincing contribution, and so I propose rejecting the paper at this point in time. Nevertheless, I do think the topic is interesting and this approach has the potential to be good.

337,"### Paper summary 
This paper investigates theoretically and empirically the effect of increasing the number of parameters (""overparameterization"") in GAN training. By analogy to what happens in supervised learning with neural networks, overparameterization does help to stabilize the training dynamics (and improve performance empirically). This paper provides an explicit threshold for the width of a 1-layer ReLU network generator so that gradient-ascent training with a linear discriminator yields a linear rate of convergence to the global saddle point (which corresponds to the empirical mean of the generator matching the mean of the data). The authors also provides a more general theorem that generalizes this result to deeper networks.

### Evaluation
The reviewers had several questions and concerns which were well addressed in the rebuttal and following discussion, in particular in terms of clarifying the meaning of ""overparameterization"". After discussing the paper, R1, R2 and R4 recommend acceptance while R3 recommends rejection. The main concern of R3 is that the GAN formulation analyzed in the paper is mainly doing moment matching between the generator  distribution (produced from a *fixed* set of latent variables z_i) and the empirical mean of the data. R3 argues that this is not sufficient to ""understanding the training of GANs"". At least two aspects are missing: how the distribution induced by the generator converges according to other notion of divergence (like KL, Wasserstein, etc.); and what about the true generator distribution (not just its empirical version from a fixed finite set of samples z_i)? While agreeing these are problematic, the other reviewers judged that the manuscript was useful first step in understanding the role of overparameterization in GANs and thus still recommend acceptance. And importantly, this paper is the first to study this question theoretically.

I also read the paper in more details. I have a feeling that some aspects of this work were already developed in the supervised learning literature; but the gradient descent-ascent dynamic aspect appears novel to me and the important question of the role of overparameterization here is both timely, novel and quite interesting. I side with R1, R2 and R4: this paper is an interesting first step, and thus I recommend acceptance. See below for additional comments to be taken in consideration for the camera ready version.

### Some detailed comments
- Beginning of section 2.3: please be clearer early on that you will keep V fixed to a random initialization rather than learning it. The fact that this is standard in some other papers is not a reason to not be clear about it.
- Theorem 2.2: in the closed form of the objective when $d$ is explicitly optimized, we are back to a more standard supervised learning formulation, for example (5) could look like regression. The authors should be more clear about this, and also mention in the main text that the core technical part used to prove Theorem 2.2 is from Oymak & Soltanolkotabi 2020 (which considers supervised learning). This should also a bit more clear in the introduction -- it seems to me that the main novelty of the work is to look at the gradient-descent dynamic, which is a bit different than the supervised learning setup, even though some parts are quite related (like the full maximization with respect to $d$).
- p.6 equation (8): typo -- the  $-\mu d_t$ term is redundant and should be removed as already included from $\nabla_d h(d,\theta)$.
- p.7 ""numerical validations"" paragraph: Please describe more clearly what is the meaning of ""final MSE"". Is this a global saddle point (and thus shows the limit of the generator to match the empirical mean), or is this coming from slowness of convergence of the method (e.g. after a fixed number of iterations, or according to some stopping criterion?). Please clarify.

345,"The reviewers all appreciated the novel concept behind the work. I agree with this, I think the principles behind the work are novel and interesting, and I would encourage the authors to improve the validation of this method and publish it in the future.

However, reviewers also raised a number of issues with the current paper: (1) the evaluation appears a bit preliminary, and could be improved significantly with additional datasets and more ablations/comparisons; (2) it's not clear if the improvements from the method are especially significant; (3) the writing could be improved (I do see that the authors made a significant number of changes and improved parts of the paper in response to reviewer concerns to a degree). Probably the writing issues could be fixed, but the skepticism about the experiment results seems harder to address, and while I recognize that the authors made an effort to point some existing ablations in the paper that do address parts of what the reviewers raised, I do think that in the balance the experimental results leave the validation of the work as somewhat borderline.

While less important for the decision, I found that the paper is somewhat overselling the contribution in the opening -- while the particular concept of using gradients as features in this way is interesting, similar ideas have been proposed in the past, and the paper would probably be better if it was more clearly positioned in the context of prior work rather than trying to present a new ""framework"" like this.

346,"The paper studies offline RL, which is an important topic in high risk domains. Compared with the existing works, this paper gives a tractable method to explicitly learn the model representation w.r.t the stationary distributions of two policies. This method is pretty general and could be paired with other pessimistic model-based RL methods.

The experiments are limited to simpler domains, and could be extended to include harder tasks from other continuous control domains. Some examples could be domains such as in Robosuite (http://robosuite.ai/) or Robogym (https://github.com/openai/robogym). These environments have higher dimensional systems with clearer implications of representation learning. 

There are concerns on writing style and comprehension. 
- The work is on the one hand very specialized, on the other hand just an incremental modification of existing methods. 
- The presentation is very dense and quite hard to grasp, even with the Appendix.
- The formalism, while important, can be very loose in terms of bounds. While that does open questions in RL theory, it would be useful for authors to be more candid about this fact in the paper.

It establishes the “cc-universality” of group CNNs, i.e. that such networks can approximate any continuous function over any compact set, using a new constructive approach which is based on a generalization of the ridgelet transform. The proof is constructive, in the sense that approximating networks are given in closed form by discretizing the transform.

356,"The paper presents a new Bayesian optimization method based on the Gaussian process bandits framework for black-box adversarial attacks. The method achieves good performance in the experiments, which was appreciated by all the reviewers.

At the same time, the presentation of the method is quite confusing, which currently precludes acceptance of the paper. In particular, during the discussion phase the reviewers were not able to decipher the algorithm based on the description presented in the paper. It is not clear how the problem is modeled as a bandit problem, what the loss function $\ell$ is minimized and why minimizing it makes sense (assuming, e.g., that $\ell$ it the hinge loss as suggested and the initial prediction is good with a large margin, that is, the loss is zero, equation 6 never changes $x_t$ when the procedure is started from $x$). This connection, since it is the fundamental contribution of the paper, should be much better explained. Once the problem is set up to estimate (maximize?) the reward, it is changed to calculating the difference in the minimization (cf. equation 11), which is again unmotivated. (Other standard aspects of the algorithm should also be explained properly, e.g., the stopping condition of Algorithm 1)

Unfortunately, the paper is written in a mathematically very imprecise manner. As an example, consider equation (6), where $B_p$ and the projection operator are not defined, and while these can be guessed, a projection of the argmin seems to be missing as well in the end (otherwise nothing guarantees that $x_T$, which is the final outcome of the algorithm, remains in the $L_p$ ball). Another example is the $Discrete\ Approximate\ CorrAttack_{Flip}$ paragraph which requires that every coordinate of $x$ should be changed by  $\pm\epsilon$. It is also not clear what ""dividing the image into several blocks"" means in Section 4.1 (e.g., are these overlapping, do they cover the whole image, etc., not to mention that previously $x$ was a general input, not necessarily an image). It is also unlikely that the stopping condition in Algorithm 1 would use the exact same $\epsilon$ for the acquisition function as the perturbation radius for adversarial examples, etc. While some of these inaccuracies and unclear definitions are also mentioned in the reviews, unfortunately there are more in the paper.

The authors are encouraged to resubmit the paper to the next venue after significantly improving and cleaning up the presentation.

360,"This submission describes an approach to compressing the communication in federated learning. The key idea is using a set of random samples from a prior distribution and then performing importance weighed sampling. The work performs an analysis of the privacy guarantees of this process and experimental evaluation.
The main issue with this work is the authors appear to be unaware that the basic problem they pose is solved in a more comprehensive and lossless way in a recent work https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12099 (Feldman and Talwar, ICML 2021). That work shows that any differentially private randomizer can be compressed via a simpler algorithm that performs rejection sampling using a PRG. The algorithm does not loose privacy or utility (under standard cryptographic assumptions) while guaranteeing low communication. In contrast this work loses significantly in utility and provides opaque privacy guarantees.

364,"This paper focuses on the problem of performing imitation learning from trajectory-level data that includes optimal as well as suboptimal demonstrations.  The authors wish to avoid the requirement of a separate filtering process that would throw away the bad trajectories.  The authors propose a clever innovation that allows for leveraging the policy that is itself being learned to reweight the samples for a next round of weighted behavioral cloning.  The paper is also somewhat theoretically rigorous and provides insight into the problem. 

The reviewers pointed out some initial issues related to clarity and the authors did a good job of addressing reviewer concerns.  Ultimately all reviewers agreed that the core innovation of the paper was interesting and empirically worked reasonably well.  

One older line of work that I think is quite relevant, but which is not discussed, is the empirically observed ""clean-up effect"", described by Michie and colleagues in the 90s (e.g. ""Learning to fly"" Sammut et al 1992).  This clean-up effect is intuitive and reportedly achieved for free in settings where the learning objective is mode-seeking and the dataset is large, insofar as the mean value of the resulting policy *should* produce actions that corresponds to the average action produced by demonstrators in the same situation.  I think it would be worth discussing how the analysis of this paper relates to this empirical phenomenon. In particular, it would be worth clarifying in what regimes the suboptimality of training from a dataset with noisy examples arises and how likely this is to effect the mean value of the learned policy (for context, it is fairly common in practice to evaluate the student policy in BC settings by only using the mean action value; perhaps this point was present in the paper, and I missed it). From a certain perspective, the innovation of this paper is to accentuate the clean-up effect.

As noted by a reviewer, and subsequently incorporated into the paper, the actual algorithm has some similarities to versions of recent ""offline RL"" algorithms (though of course it does not leverage rewards).  In particular, the motif of performing a weighted regression could perhaps be a bit more thoroughly contextualized by connecting it to other weighting factors (e.g. see Critic Regularized Regression).  That said, I leave this entirely to the discretion of the authors.

The final scores were 8, 7, & 6.  I see this as a strong paper and will endorse it for a spotlight.

","This paper introduces a new offline imitation learning algorithm, to be compared with BC . The main idea (and difference with simple BC) is to re-use the old learned policy as a reward function in a policy- gradient step .

365,"This paper proposes an extra loss to add on top of the contrastive learning. The contrastive learning seek representations invariant to transformation, while the extra loss the authors proposed encourage representations to be equivariant to the transformation (i.e. retain information about transformation in later representations). While reviewers and I agree this is a sensible motivation, and acknowledge good results that authors have obtained, the fact that most, if not all, improvement is combing from the 4-way rotation transformation is a bit unsatisfactory. Furthermore, this additional loss was proposed before and is actually quite well known, so the actual novelty in the proposed technique is somewhat limited. Nevertheless, this paper provides a comprehensive evaluation, obtaining a reasonable improvement, and makes a good case for using an equivariant seeking loss.

366,"This paper presents a closed loop planning system that leverages LLMs for providing candidate plans given the success of action execution and the world state. Central to the approach is querying the LLM given the instruction and text prompts capturing success of skill execution and a description of the scene. 

This is a systems oriented paper demonstrating and evaluating the utility of a LLM for interleaved planning and execution. The paper is well organised and clearly written. The results highlight the utility of LLMs to enable task execution before an explicit learning of a task model (given primitive robot skills amenable to composition). Further, experiments demonstrate contextual plan adaptation and success goal reaching for simulated and real data sets. 

The main limitation of the work was observed to be the specialised nature of feedback prompts necessary for successful task execution. A clarification was sought if the proposed system has a principled way to determining the necessary feedback and to what extent the feedback is to be adjusted for long-running plans. In response, the authors clarified that the feedback is not hand crafted. Further,  the authors articulated their contribution towards demonstrating  the ability of LLM-based planners to integrated multi-modal feedback without focusing on the specific problem of determine how much or how best such a feedback may be generated. In response to a reviewer’s suggestion, the authors provided a comparison of models with and without feedback with an increase in the task horizon. 

Additionally, the reviewers inquired the degree to which plan recovery is possible in the proposed framework. In response, the authors drew attention to results where plan adaptation occurs when an object falls is no longer in the reachable workspace. The reviewers further requested for a comparison with a baseline that searches over a set of high-candidate plans. As suggested, the authors provided a comparison with a Next Best Decoding that uses the next most likely skill.

371,"This paper presents a significant collection of unlabelled signing data (4.6K hours) across 10 sign languages, which have been pre-processed and converted to pose-keypoints to remove identifiable information.

Furthermore, the paper also provides a multilingual model, Sign2Vec, pre-trained on the unlabelled data, and fine-tuned on the labelled data, which shows the SOTA results for known tasks. Lastly, the paper also introduces a dataset for fingerspelling across 7 languages. It's likely that this work will pave the way for new research on multilingual signed language tasks.

* The paper provides a significant expansion for unlabelled and labelled signed data (previous work focused only on Indian Signed Languages)
* The data gathering procedure is well documented and justified
* The experimental results provide evidence of the value of the data.

Also, I would have used bigger NNs that can be trained to overfit the sigmoid outputs for classification of higher accuracy. I believe that having a diversity of underlying classifiers is more relevant than having 125 datasets. We need to find the best classifier or ensemble and then apply the different mechanisms for estimating if the output is the correct one. Otherwise, the proposed method might only be workable for this specific NN configuration. In the tables, it can be hinted that this might be happening, as about 80% of the cases MCP and RED are indistinguishable in the AUROC values.
 
Also, for all of these datasets a GP could be used as an underlying classifier, and given the premises of this paper, the authors could check how well calibrate a GP classifier is. Also, there has been considerable work on calibrating NNs when they are trained to overfit. Comparing with those methods should be straightforward, as they provide more information than just a confidence score. This is probably the most influential paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04599 (1000+ references), but there are some recent papers too.  
 
Finally, if the goal is to use a GP to detect if the classification done by the NNs is accurate, using a GP might be an overkill, as the complexity of the GP, especially for large datasets might end up being larger than the underlying classifier.

396,"The paper is proposing a new framework for understanding generalization in the deep learning. The main idea is considering the difference of stochastic optimization on a population risk and optimization on an empirical risk. The classical theory considers the difference of empirical risk and population risk. This basically translates the practical motivation from finding good function classes to finding good optimizers which can re-use the data effectively. Although the paper provides no theoretical result, it provides an interesting empirical study. The paper somewhat demonstrates that SGD on deep networks is somehow good at re-using the same data. I believe this angle is very novel and might hope to future theoretical discoveries. The paper is reviewed by four reviewers and two of them argue its acceptance and two of them argue rejection. After discussion, this status remained and I carefully read and reviewed the paper. Here are the major issues raised by the reviewers:

- R#1: The paper is missing a theoretical study. The implications on the practical deep learning is not clear.
- R#2: Choice of the soft-error is particular to the task and how to go beyond soft-max is not clear.
- R#3: Finds the paper not novel as well as trivial or hard to understand.
- R#4: The choice of soft error is ad-hoc.

I believe the issues raised by R#3 are not justified. First of all, novelty is very clear and. appreciated by other reviewers. Moreover, the paper is rather easy to understand and the results are very farm from trivial. However, the other issues raised by other reviewers are valid. Specifically, soft-error seems to be a limitation of the study. However, the authors respond to this concern and reviewer increases their score. I believe the theory is lacking but the paper is simply showing this novel approach and its empirical validity. A theory to explain this phenomenon would be amazing but not necessary for publication. Similarly, without a theory it is hard to expect any practical implication. Overall, I believe the paper is an interesting and novel one which will likely to lead additional work in the area. Considering we are still far from a satisfying theory of generalization for deep learning and the role of the optimization is clear, this angle worth sharing with the community. Hence, I decide to accept. However, I have some concerns which should be addressed by the camera-ready. 

- Claims should be revised and authors should make sure they have enough evidence for them. For example, authors provide no satisfying evidence for random labels or very limited evidence for pre-training. I strongly recommend authors to either remove some of these discussions or present in a fashion which is not a result but part of the discussion for future research.
- A section about limitations should be added. Specifically, the soft-error choice should be discussed in this limitation section.
- Discussion section should be extended with the pointers to the relevant work on bootstrap literature as well as suggestions to the theoreticians. Not providing any theoretical result is always fine but authors should understanding why is it hard to make theoretical statements and where to search them.

","The bootstrap framework suggests that understanding generalization reduces to understanding optimization in the online setting . Empirically, it demonstrates that such gap (soft-error) is small in supervised image classification for typical deep learning model architectures .

Over-smoothing refers to token uniformity problem in BERT, different input patches mapping to similar latent representation in ViT and the problem of shallower representation better than deeper (overthinking). The authors build a relationship between Transformer blocks and graphs. Namely, self-attention matrix can be regarded as a normalized adjacency matrix of a weighted graph. They prove that if the standard deviation in layer normalization is sufficiently large, the outputs of the transformer stack will converge to a low-rank subspace, resulting in over-smoothing.

In this paper, they also provide theoretical proof why higher layers can lead to over-smoothing. Empirically , they investigate the effects of the magnitude of the two standard deviations between two consecutive layers on possible over-smoothing in diverse tasks.

In order to overcome over-smoothing, they propose a series of hierarchical fusion strategy that adaptively fuses presentation from different layers, including concatenation fusion, max fusion and self-gate fusion into post-normalization. These strategies reduce similarities between tokens and outperforms BERT baseline on a few datasets (GLUE, SWAG and SQuAD).

the paper has done much to actually demystify transferability, it does take
steps towards performing scientific experiments to understand why it is so
hard. And these experiments, while not perfect, can serve as the basis for
future work to extend and understand which factors are most important.

The paper presents a method for encoding a compressed version of an implicit 3D scene, from given images from arbitrary view points. This is achieved via a function, learning with a NeRF model, that maps spatial coordinates to a radiance vector field and is optimized for high compressibility and low reconstruction error. Results shows better compression, higher reconstruction quality and lower bitrates compared to other STOA.

Strengths:
- Method for significantly compressing NerF models, which is very useful since such models are often trained for every new scene
- Retain reconstruction quality after compression by an order of magnitude
 
Weaknesses:
- The need for decompressing the model before rendering can be done means reduced rendering speed. This also requires longer training times.
- Experiments against other scene compression + neural rendering technique will have further strengthened the papers’s claims 
- The techniques used are well established, and thus there is not as much technical novelty.

Additionally, they characterize voice at the utterance level to capture stationary factors like background acoustic conditions and at the phoneme level to capture factors such as prosody, though there are no explicit constraints to force such representation.

- Results on simulated data look promising.
- The theoretical part and the implementation is clear, too bad the code is not shared.

Cons :
- The responses to the reviewers are very dense, often repeat the same explanations from one reviewer to another and lack relevance. It is not clear what has been changed in the manuscript in particular.
- The proof of concept should have been to support in the claims of the authors, as well as the use of simulated data in the title as suggested by the last reviewer

Experimental results seem to be generally good, and in the rebuttal the authors have provided further experimental support to their main claim.  There are however some issues that have not been solved by the author’s rebuttal. I think two of them are the most important and related: 

i) significance of contribution: although the authors have tried in the rebuttal to explain how the proposed approach differs from related papers, it seems that there are still doubts about the amount of innovation introduced by the paper. This issue could have been mitigated by SOTA experimental results in presence of a proper model selection, that, however does not seem to be the case here (see next point);

ii) model selection: the authors did not clearly explain the model selection procedure in the rebuttal. This is an important issue since it is often easy to get good results by picking the best run a posteriori. Unfortunately in the literature there are highly cited papers where model selection is not performed in a proper way and reviewers very often reject papers just looking at numbers without looking at how the numbers were obtained.

457,"The paper analyzes diffusion-based deep generative models (DDGMs). The paper postulates that a DDGMs can be divided into two parts, a denoiser and a generator. 

After the rebuttal and discussion period, three out of four reviewers supported acceptance of the paper. The reviewers aLmZ, QKfo, and 4jY9 all find the interpretation of a diffusion-based deep generative model as a decomposition of a generator and denoising part interesting. Those reviewers also note that this interpretation is useful as parts of the diffusion steps can potentially be replaced with a VAE, which would make the synthesis more efficient.

The reviewers aLmZ and QKFo also note that one comparison is perhaps slightly unfair in that the number of parameters of the two models considered was different; the authors cleared this up with new simulations showing that matching the number of parameters (as should be done for a better comparison) does not substantially change the conclusions of the experiment. 

Finally, reviewer s9uB finds the approach and observations not to be novel and states that similar observations have been made in a recent CVPR paper by Benny and Wolf. While both the paper by Benny and Wolf and the paper under review study denoising diffusion models, the approaches taken by the two papers are substantially different, and both provide value to the community.

I also find the interpretation of the DDGMs as a denoiser and generator to be interesting and useful and therefore recommend acceptance of the paper.

458,"The paper proposes a framework of Symbolic Reward Machine (SRM), an extension of Reward Machine (RM), for specifying interpretable and explainable reward functions. Then, a Bayesian IRL method is proposed to concretize an SRM using expert demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SRMs in terms of training efficiency and generalization. The reviewers acknowledged that the problem of inferring symbolic rewards is important and that the proposed SRM framework is an important step in this direction. However, the reviewers pointed out several weaknesses in the paper and shared concerns, including (a) limited comparison with alternate approaches to tackle the problem and positioning w.r.t. the existing literature; (b) the domains seem rather simple since they require only a few demonstrations (implying that the holes being inferred might be quite small); (c) the novelty and theory around the SRM representation is not fully clear.

459,"This paper proposes a method for neural architecture search (NAS) based on adversarial methods. It uses a discriminator trained to distinguish between random vs. good architectures, letting the discriminator's scores serve as a reward signal for an autoregressive generator. I agree with AR1: this is a nice and clever idea. Reviewers generally agreed that the method was interesting, e.g. it's quite flexible in that it's able to incorporate constraints, and that the evaluation is rather extensive and shows that the method performs well across the board. Many minor criticisms were raised and addressed well by the authors in their responses and manuscript updates.

The major criticism shared by most reviewers was the high methodological complexity of the proposed approach, and the proportionally small gains shown over much simpler baselines. This criticism remained despite the authors' responses. The method is indeed complex: the same method without any adversarial component already performs well, and many important details of the model are relegated to Appendix A.2. (I would recommend, for example, moving Fig. 2 to the main text if at all possible. Also, the Appendix can/should be included in the main PDF for ICLR, rather than in supplementary material, as AR1 mentions.) It was not clear to reviewers that the adversarial component of the approach has a significant benefit. The authors respond by pointing to Table 7 showing that the discriminator reduces the number of queries and points out that in reality these queries correspond to expensive evaluations. If this is a major selling point of the method (it sounds like it could be), it should be highlighted and analyzed far more -- at least moved to the main text rather than an Appendix -- ideally with a real-world evaluation showing a practical large improvement in overall wall-clock time, rather than a benchmark where these evaluations are free. Perhaps the exclusive reliance on these benchmarks, though undoubtedly useful for quick experimentation, in the end holds back the paper and prevents the method's benefits from becoming apparent to the readers.

As a minor point (also raised by AR1), the paper is formatted incorrectly for ICLR: the font color is off, and more importantly the PDF is unsearchable (text cannot be selected, ctrl-F does not work), which makes it very difficult to quickly reference and review. Please try not to stray from the conference-provided style file for future submissions.

I appreciate the cleverness of the method, the extent of the evaluation, and the thorough responses to the reviews. However, unfortunately with the current presentation, it is too difficult to discern the benefit of the proposed approach from the manuscript. The approach is nonetheless intuitively appealing and seems quite promising, and I hope the authors will take the reviewers' good feedback into account and resubmit the paper in the future.

The paper starts with an explicit bounding constraint on the manifold (and relaxes to the ball constraint for certain manifolds) and shows that the proposed algorithm can respect that while achieving acceleration. The reviewers including this AC see the merits of the paper. However, the paper in its current form is far from complete. A particular concern is on the empirical performance of the algorithm, resolving which should strengthen the paper. I would encourage the authors to build on the discussions and polish the paper accordingly.

Even though the paper has positive scores, the paper in its current form is a borderline paper with significant scope for improvement. To this end, the AC cannot accept the paper.

463,"This proposal introduces CylesGym, the first Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmark targeted at long horizon decision making in agriculture. Crucially, while prior work addresses single-year decision making, CylesGym captures the long term effects that one year's crop has on future generations. 

The benchmark is clearly highly relevant and opens up a new frontier for RL researchers, making it a valuable contribution to the field. Furthermore, the benchmark does a good job of highlighting interesting opportunities for RL method development, such as costly information gathering, and evaluating current algorithms compared to baselines. 

There was an active discussion between the reviewers and authors of the benchmark which resolved the majority of issues raised in the initial reviews. As a result there is broad support across the reviewers for the paper. A lingering concern is the sim-to-real gap which is mentioned at a number of places in the paper but could be emphasised more. 

Lastly, the paper is well written and the evaluation sound. I believe this benchmark will be welcome by the community but I recommend that the authors address the concerns regarding the writing raised by  Reviewer MEYG, in particular regarding the utility for the agriculture community. In general I do not believe that issues which can be addressed in writing should be a reason to reject but those concerns should be addressed for the final version.

465,"This paper explores the effect on decoding accuracy (predicting hidden representations from fMRI datasets) from fine tuning models by injecting structural bias.  This paper specifically focuses the attention of BERT on syntactic features of the text, which (for one dataset) appears to improve the decoding performance.

The review period was very productive.  There were some questions about analyses, and the validity of the statistical tests, but through some very thorough back and forth with the reviewers, this seems to have been resolved.  There is a good amount of analysis done on the resulting language models to try and determine the impact of finetuning or attention on the models. However, the results on the fMRI two datasets appear to be very different, and it's unclear why (and isn't clearly related back to the extensive language model analyses).  We would have liked to have seen a more thorough analysis of the stark difference in performance, and some convincing explanations for the difference based on the analyses.

470,"This paper is a computational linguistic study of the semantics that can be inferred form text corpora given parsers (which are trained on human data) are used to infer the verbs and their objects in text. The reviewers agreed that the work was well executed, and that the experiments comparing the resulting representations to human data were solid. The method employed has little or no technical novelty (in my opinion, not necessarily a flaw), and it's not clear what tasks (beyond capturing human data) representations could be applied to (again, not a problem if the goal is to develop theories of cognition). 

The first draft of the work missed important connections to the computational linguistics literature, where learning about 'affordances for verbs' (referred to as 'selectional preferences') has long been an important goal. The authors did a good job of setting out these connections in the revised manuscript, which the reviewers appreciated. 

The work is well executed, and should be commended for relating ideas from different sub-fields in its motivation and framing. But my sincere view is that it does not meet the same standards of machine-learning or technical novelty met by other papers at this conference. It is unclear to me what the framing in terms of 'affordance' adds to a large body of literature studying the semantics of word embeddings, given various syntactically and semantically-informed innovations.  It feels to me like this work would have been an important contribution to the literature in 2013, but given the current state of the art in representation learning from text and jointly learning from text and other modalities, I would like to have seen some attempt to incorporate these techniques and bridge the gap between the notion of affordance in text/verbs (selectional preference) and Gibson's notion of object affordance (what you can do physically with an object) in experiments and modelling, not just in the discussion. Such a programme of research could yield fascinating insights into the nature of grounding, and the continuum from the concrete, which can be perceived and directly experienced, to the abstract, which must be learned from text. I encourage the authors to continue in this direction. An alternative is to consider submitting the current manuscript to venue where the primary focus is cognitive modelling, and accounting for human, behavioural data, and where there is less emphasis on the development of novel methods or models.

For these reasons, and considering the technical scope of related papers in the programme, I cannot fairly recommend acceptance in this case.

472,"In the context of recurrent neural networks, the motivation of the paper is to explore the ""space"" between fully trained models and almost not trained models, e.g. echo state networks, using a formal approach. In fact, a modular approach has proven to be very successful in many practical applications, and in addition brain seems to adopt this strategy as well. The addressed theoretical issue is stability of the network (i.e., the network implements a contraction map.) Specifically, it is assumed that a network is composed of a set of subnetworks that meet by construction some stability condition, and the problem is to design a mixing weight matrix, interconnecting the latent spaces of the subnetworks, able to give stability guarantees during and after training. Some novel stability conditions are proposed as well as two different approaches to design a successful mixing weight matrix. The original submitted paper was not easy to read, and after revision major problems with presentation have been resolved, although the current version looks more like an ordered collection of results/statements than a smooth and integrated flow of discourse. The revision has also addressed some concerns by reviewers on the role of size and sparsity of the modules, as well as the sensitivity of the stabilization condition on the mixing weight matrix has been experimentally assessed, obtaining interesting results. Overall the paper reports interesting results, however the novelty of the contribution seems to be a bit weak, e.g. stability conditions on recurrent networks (although different from the reported ones) were already presented in literature. Also the idea of exploiting, in one of the proposed models,  the fact that the matrix exponential of a skew-symmetric matrix is orthogonal to maintain the convergence condition during training, is not novel. Moreover, the experimental assessment does not provide a direct comparison, under the same architectural/learning setting, of the novel stability results versus the ones already presented in literature. Empirical results are obtained on simple tasks (using datasets with sequences of identical length), and relatively small networks, which limits a bit the scope of the assessment, as well as it is not clear if the observed improvements (where obtained) are statistically significant (especially when compared with results obtained by networks with the same order of parameters.) The quality of the assessment would increase significantly by considering datasets with sequences of different lengths, and involving more challenging tasks that do require larger networks.

The model is trained using an inverse dynamics model and attention mechanism and is shown to be able to identify the controllable character. The resulting exploration approach achieves strong empirical results compared to alternative count-based exploration techniques. The reviewers note that the novel approach has potential for opening up potential fruitful directions for follow-up research. The obtained strong empirical results are another strong indication of the value of the proposed idea.


The reviewers mention several potential weaknesses. First, while the proposed idea is general, the specific implementation seems targetted specifically towards Atari games. While Atari is a popular benchmark domain, this raises questions as to whether insights can be more generally applied. Second, several questions were raised regarding the motivation for some of the presented modeling choices (e.g., loss terms) as well as their impact on the empirical results. Ablation studies were recommended as a step to resolving these questions Reviewer 3 questioned whether the learned state representation could be directly used as an additional input to the agent, and if it would improve performance. Finally, several related works were suggested that should be included in the discussion of related work.

480,"Strengths:
Paper uses an efficient inference procedure cutting inference time on intermediate frames by 53%, & yields better accuracy and IOU compared to the one recent closely related work.

The ablation study seems sufficient and well-designed. The paper presents two feature propagation strategies and three feature fusion methods. The experiments compare these different settings, and show that interpolation-BMV is indeed a better feature propagation.

Weaknesses: Reviewers believed the work to be of limited novelty. The algorithm is close to the optical-flow based models Shelhamer et al. (2016) and Zhu et al. (2017). Reviewer asserts that the main difference is that the optical-flow is replaced with BMV, which is a byproduct of modern cameras.  R3 felt that there was Insufficient experimental comparison with other baselines and that technical details were not clear enough.

Contention: Authors assert that Shelhamer et al. (2016) does not use optical flow, and instead simply copies features from frame to frame (and schedules this copying). Zhu et al. (2017) then proposes an improvement to this scheme, forward feature warping with optical flow. In general, both these techniques fail to achieve speedups beyond small multiples of the baseline (< 3x), without impacting accuracy.

Consensus: It was disappointing that some of the reviewers did not engage after the author review (perhaps initial impressions were just too low). However, after the author rebuttal R1 did respond and held to the position that the work should not be accepted, justified by the assertion that other modern architectures that are lighter weight and are able to produce fast predictions.

Reviewer 1 echoes many of these concerns.

485,"This paper is truly borderline. On one hand, the theoretical contribution seems novel and interesting, however, there appears to be somewhat of a gap between theory and practice. 

There is unfortunately another problem. According to the authors, the main contribution of this publication is arguably the introduction of the nearest neighbor as the positive example in the triplet loss. However, the authors seem to be unaware of the history of the triplet loss. It was originally introduced by Schultz & Joachims 2004 as a loss over all triplets.  Weinberger et al. 2005 changed it and use the nearest neighbor as ""target neighbor"", which is called ""easy positives"" here, as the objective of LMNN. In 2009 Chechik et al. subsequently relaxed this positive neighbor formulation to any similarly labeled sample (going back to the Schultz & Joachims formulation) but sampling triplets. The re-introduction of the nearest neighbor as ""easy positive"" was then covered by Xuan et al. 2020.  

Unfortunately all of this diminishes the novelty significantly and it is clear that the paper in its current form does not have a strong enough contribution. I do encourage the authors to take a close look at the original LMNN publication and Xuan et al and write an improved re-submission for the next conference that maybe focuses more on the theoretical contribution. 
Good luck,

489,"The paper in its most recent version claims that deep neural networks, when very carefully regularized, outperform methods such as Gradient Boosting Trees on tabular data. This is genuinely surprising to me (in a good way), and I suppose it is as well to the community.

The paper initially received negative reviews with two key remarks that ""The results are somewhat expected."" (R4, R3, R2). Indeed, the original version mainly stated that very careful regularization helps on tabular data.  Naturally, the reviewers (including myself) seen then as the second key weakness that ""All experiments are run on tabular data."" (R4, R3).

Based on the reviews, the Authors have clarified and changed their message. I think it is well summarized by R2 ""The paper has been significantly refocused and now sells itself as a way of deep neural networks being competitive versus gradient boosting methods, which are dominating the tabular heterogeneous tasks.""

As R2 said and was reflected in comments by other reviewers, ""[...] convinced by authors response on paper novelty, technical contribution and (after the re-focusing) potential usefulness to the community"".

Given the new message of the paper, a key new question surfaces. Is this indeed the first convincing demonstration that deep learning can outperform more standard methods on tabular data? R2 pointed out TabNet (see also Google Cloud offering) that already in 2019 claimed ""beating GB methods for the tabular data"". There is also NeurIPS work ""Regularization Learning Networks: Deep Learning
for Tabular Datasets""; their abstract opens with ""Despite their impressive performance, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) typically underperform Gradient Boosting Trees (GBTs) on many tabular-dataset learning tasks. We propose that applying a different regularization coefficient to each weight might boost the performance of DNNs by allowing them to make more use
of the more relevant inputs"". The latter work did not claim to beat GBT. Regardless, the two works should be carefully discussed and compared empirically to in the new version of the work. 

I am also not yet fully convinced by the added comparison to GDBT. Arguably, AutoML from the sklearn package is not the most popular way to use GDBT in practice. How would regularization cocktails compare to GDBT from XGBoost, optimized using either random search or bayesian optimization?

Based on the above, I have to recommend the rejection of the paper. The key reason is: *the new reframing of the paper is exciting but warrants a much more detailed and careful evaluation*.

I really appreciate the work the Authors have put in clarifying and changing the message of the paper. I understand this is disappointing that we won't be able to include the work in ICLR.

The paper gives lower bounds on the bit complexity for two settings: non-convex functions satisfying a PL condition and overparameterized quadratics. The authors then give an algorithm that (1) for PL objectives, has optimal communication complexity (up to logarithmic terms in the dimension of the problem) and (2) for quadratic overparameterized objectives, attains optimal communication complexity (up to logarithmic terms) with high probability.

This paper generated significant discussion in the initial author-reviewer discussion period. Most of the reviewers were quite positive on the paper, and found the results to be interesting and relevant to the community, and found the paper to be well-written. They found the results, which provide near-optimal sample complexity for two settings (PL functions and overparameterized quadratics) to be technically strong, and were impressed by the tightness of the results. One reviewer took issue with certain limitations of the paper, including:
- A limitation of the lower bounds in the paper is that they concern only deterministic methods.
- The results are only tight with respect to the parameters $D$, $N$, and $\epsilon$, and are not necessarily tight with respect to $L$ and $\mu$.
- Some related work can be discussed in more detail.

To tackle the problem, the authors first define a domain specific language (DSL) such that modular concepts can be represented in a network-friendly manner.

A Transformer-based detection module takes in a CAD sketch sequence and outputs a a set of latent embeddings, which are further decoded to parameterized modular concepts by a generation module. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end self-supervised manner, using reconstruction loss plus regularization terms.

509,"Meta Review: The paper proposes a novel quantitative measure for risk in RL. The measure is sensitive to aleatoric and epistemic risk, and avoids some theoretical issues with previously proposed additive measures of the two types of risk. The paper also proposes a novel risk sensitive RL algorithm (based on ensemble bootstrapping and distributional RL). The method performs well empirically.

Pro:
* All reviewers agree that the proposed measure and algorithm is novel, sound, and original. 
* 3 out of 4 reviewers agree that the paper is well written. 
* The topic of risk sensitive RL is timely and important - 3 out of 4 reviewers rate the potential impact as good (3).
* Empirical results justify the theoretical claims and the method performs well compared to other distributional RL methods

Con:
* In their initial assessment, reviewers point out minor technical flaws and some difficulties in understanding parts of the empirical evaluation. The authors have commented on the issues raised, but only 1 reviewer has responded to the authors' comments.
* PeBL points out a potential shortcoming w.r.t. the training protocol (splitting the data). Authors acknowledge this and point to other papers in the literature using a similar protocol.
* The method seems somewhat complicated and could perhaps be presented better - this is based on questions raised by reviewers, and these questions should be helpful for the authors to improve the camera-ready presentation.

**Justification of recommendation:** 3 of 4 reviewers are in favor of accepting the paper. The only (weakly) negative reviewer has raised some major issues that are answered in the appendix of the paper (but the reviewer did not find the appendix) and answered in other sections of the paper (as pointed out by the authors). To me, the authors have adequately addressed all major and most minor comments in their extensive response (including the major issues raised by the negative reviewer) - unfortunately only the most positive reviewer responded to the rebuttal. Taking all this information together I can still confidently recommend acceptance of the paper.

511,"The authors propose to inspect learned models based on their maximum deviation to a reference model.

Reviewers all appreciated the novelty and importance of the proposed problem and the contributions made to examine the feasibility of solving it. Their main concerns were regarding the limited discussion on choosing the reference model and the certification set. The authors expanded greatly on this in their rebuttal and in a revision to the paper.

I think the added discussion asked for by reviewers is well within what could be expected to be added for a camera-ready version (and indeed, this is already in the Appendix of the revision).

512,"This paper presents an intriguing empirical phenomenon in deep learning. They train a variety of architectures for different tasks using different datasets and study the relationship between the learned representations. In particular they collect the representations into a large matrix and take the top left singular vector and measure the cosine of the angle. They show that it is much smaller than one might expect, about 10 degrees or so, and has an approximate monotonicity property as the network is being trained although it does not seem to converge to zero. Moreover this measure also correlates with performance. 

The reviewers had divided opinions on this paper. On the one hand, the range of experiments is impressive and truly demonstrates that this is a pervasive phenomenon. On the other hand, it is not so clear what it means. In particular, suppose we have a collection of graphs which have close to the same degree distributions. If we take the top left singular vectors of all the adjacency matrices, they would also have low angles between them. While this is a very different setting and there is no analogy between the experiments in this paper and this toy model, it does raise philosophical questions about whether the phenomenon is meaningful or is a byproduct of something else about the data. This may be a challenging question to answer, but one reviewer brought up a natural next step: One could measure the principal angle between the subspace of the top k left singular vectors across experiments for larger values of k. The authors do bring up the point that the spectrum decays very quickly, so it could be that beyond a certain point the singular vectors behave somewhat randomly.

515,"Reviews were split. Reviewers agreed on the importance of the domain but differed in how they valued the contribution over ProteomeTools, which the dataset builds upon. A primary concern was lack of baselines/benchmarking. The rebuttal argues that baselines would not add much value since strong methods have been published in prior work. However, my interpretation of the reviewers ask is not to invent new heuristic baselines but to evaluate the prior methods on the newly prepared dataset. The authors do add evaluation of one such model (Prosit) to the revision. Evaluating more models in the same way could strengthen the contribution, and could be part of the ongoing maintenance of the dataset / code.

Overall, however, the majority of reviewers felt the paper does provide significant value beyond ProteomeTools and other prior work, through the new annotations, tooling, and usage recommendations. The revision adds an appendix (G) to clarify these contributions, and it may be useful to move some of that text into the intro of the paper (as I think many readers will want to know what are the main contributions beyond the base dataset).

525,"The goal of the paper is to learn policies that can solve a given task while adhering to certain constraints specified via natural language. The paper closely builds upon prior work on constrained RL and passes the representation of natural language constraints by pre-training an interpreter. Experiments are done in a new proposed 2D grid-world benchmark. Although reviewers liked the premise, the main issue raised is that the way natural language constraints are handled is no different from the way it is done in prior work on constrained RL. The authors provided the rebuttal and addressed some of the concerns regarding paper details. However, upon discussion post rebuttal, the reviewers and AC feel that the paper does not provide clear scientific insight because the natural language part is processed separately from the policy learning part. We also believe that the paper will immensely benefit with results in more complex environments beyond the 2D grid-world. Please refer to the reviews for final feedback and suggestions to strengthen the submission.

526,"This paper takes on (in my view) one of the most important questions in the lottery ticket literature today: how small are the smallest lottery tickets that exist in our neural networks? Many methods have been proposed for finding weak lottery tickets (those that require training to reach full accuracy) and strong lottery tickets (those that do not), but we have no idea how close they come to finding the smallest lottery tickets. Moreover, in many cases, we only know how to find lottery ticket subnetworks early in training rather than at initialization. Is this a fundamental limitation on the existence of lottery tickets, or is this simply a limitation of our methods for finding them? I am personally very involved in lottery ticket conversations in the literature, and I believe I can speak with some authority when I say that these are vital questions where any progress is important.

Moreover, these are exceedingly difficult research questions, and (again, in my view) the authors should be commended for taking them on. A naive approach to these questions would involve brute force search over all possible subnetworks, which is infeasible even on the smallest of toy examples, let alone the meaningful computer vision tasks where lottery ticket work typically focuses.

I am sharing all of this information to provide background for my confident recommendation to accept this paper over the many legitimate concerns expressed by reviewers and those that I saw when reading the paper in detail. Those include that:
* This paper does not solve any of these research problems in their entirety.
* It focuses on toy networks smaller than those traditionally studied in the lottery ticket literature, and it is well known that lottery ticket behavior changes in character at larger scales.
* Planting good subnetworks may be an unrealistic proxy for the kinds of subnetworks that actually emerge naturally.
* There may be multiple good subnetworks in a network, not just the one that was planted.
* The graphs are a bit hard to read.
* I find the mix of pruning methods studied, which were designed with very different goals (pruning after training, pruning before training, finding strong lottery tickets), a bit confusing.

**The bottom line:** With all of that said, in my view, the paper asks good questions and provides an initial foothold that other researchers will be able to build on as we seek more general answers. This is similar to the contributions made by Zhou et al., which started the conversation on strong lottery tickets, and potentially even Frankle & Carbin, which kicked off the lottery ticket discussion but got many things wrong. Both papers were good first attempts at solving big problems, and both were highly influential despite their flaws. Similarly, even if this submission isn't perfect in every way, this is among the most important kinds of contributions that a paper can make. For that reason, I strongly recommend acceptance under the belief that this paper will help to foster a valuable conversation in the literature.

P.S. I really, truly, strongly beg the authors to redo their graphs following the style of some of the more user-friendly lottery ticket or pruning papers they have cited (e.g., Frankle et al., 2021). The graphs in this paper were really hard to parse. Really really really hard to parse. They're too small, the y-axis is often squished, gridlines would be helpful, the lines are overlapping in ways that are difficult to distinguish because the colors blend, etc. etc. This is quite possibly the biggest impediment I see to this paper's ability to have broader influence.

","The authors provide an interesting new avenue for evaluating pruning methods, with the use of ground truth sparse networks .

There was a significant amount of disagreement between the reviewers. Some seemed to think the strength of mostly linear methods meant that the benchmarks were too easy, but these are standard graph neural network benchmarks. A simple model performing well is not a negative, and can often be useful for puncturing hype (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13211). Simple architectures can also be useful for providing analytic insights which might get obscured in more complex models. Some reviewers seemed concerned about the scaling of certain tools (e.g. graph Laplacian eigenvectors), but these tools are only used for analysis, not for training. Nevertheless, I feel that there were enough general concerns around the paper that I have a difficult time recommending acceptance.

545,"All of the reviewers recommended acceptance, but the support was lukewarm, with the maximum score being “Weak Accept”. There were concerns about the limited applicability of the proposed method and lack of clarity of some of the arguments in the paper. Although the reviewers appreciated the mathematical foundations and experimental results, the negatives outweighed the positives. 

","This paper proposes a pluggable method that learns a dynamic prediction error bound for some error-bounded learned indexes . With the proposed method, the learned index can make a better trade-off between space and time . The paper presents a method to learn a variable error bound to use when building piecewise linear segments for learned indices for databases . It is based on an estimation function that uses a sample to estimate the mean and the variance of the remaining data which will be covered by the next linear segment .",0.1506849315068493,0.7286309003829956,0.7425169944763184,0.735508382320404,INCORRECT,0.8848588466644287
546,"**Overview** This paper provides a way to combine SVRG and greedy-GQ to improve the algorithm performance. In particular, the finite iteration complexity is improved from $\epsilon^{-3}$ to $\epsilon^{-2}$.

**Pros** The paper is well-written. Reviewers believe this is a solid theoretical work on advancing value-based algorithms for off-policy optimal control. It has sufficient theoretical advancement and experiments demonstrations of the methods. 

**Cons** Some reviewers are concerned that SVRG is not SOTA. SVRG is not used in practice. The techniques appear to be similar to some existing works. 

**Recommendation** The meta-reviewer believes that the paper has solid theoretical contributions. SVRG is a component in the new algorithm to improve the complexity. It does not need to be ""useful"" or ""SOTA"". The paper is also well-written. Hence the recommendation is accept.

","The paper introduces a variance-reduced version of the Greedy-GQ algorithm for off-policy control . The reviewer says the paper uses SVRG for variance reduction, not the state-of-the-art method . The convergence results may not be as useful as other algorithms that can guarantee the convergence of the last iterate of the average iterate . Despite some concerns listed below, I recommend accepting the paper for publication .",0.20487804878048782,0.8113841414451599,0.735459566116333,0.7715585231781006,INCORRECT,0.9731742143630981
547,"The paper presents a sound and efficient (but not complete) algorithm for verifying that a piecewise-linear neural network is constant in an Lp ball around a given point. This is a significant contribution towards practical protection from adversarial attacks with theoretical guarantees. The proposed algorithm is shown to be sound (that is, when it returns a result, that result is guaranteed to be correct) and efficient (it is easily parallelizable and can scale to large networks), but is not complete (there exist cases where the algorithm will return ""I don't know""). The experiments show good results in practice. The reviewers are positive about the paper, and most initial concerns have been addressed in the rebuttal, with the paper improving as a result. Overall, this is an important contribution worth communicating to the ICLR community, so I'm happy to recommend acceptance.

","An algorithm to verify whether or not there exists an adversarial example in an Lp ball of size espilon around a given training sample . As opposed to previous similar algorithm (Geocert), it sacrifices completeness in order to gain efficiency . In addition, the authors explain how to take advantage of the Neural network structure to make the algorithm more efficient . The scalability to large networks seems to be an issue, although the proposed method significantly outperforms prior work .",0.16363636363636364,0.8142353296279907,0.7649893760681152,0.7888444662094116,CORRECT,0.9994087219238281
548,"The paper proposes a novel protocol for examining the inductive biases in learning systems, by quantifying the exemplar-rule trade-off (as measured by the exemplar-vs-rule propensity (EVR) defined in Eq. (2)) while controlling for feature-level bias. 

Reviewers mostly agree that the problem studied in this paper is practically relevant and that the two bias measures are potentially interesting and (jointly) more informative than existing measures such as spurious correlation. However, a shared concern among the reviewers (with confidences scores >=3) is the clarity of the exposition (e.g., many key concepts such as the data conditions are informally specified [Section 2 (Reviewer TPBn)], some key messages not clearly conveyed in the main paper [Section 3 (Reviewer RJtk)], and results inconclusive or not sufficiently supported by the experimental results [for both the synthetic setting (Reviewer RJtk) and the real-world setting (Reviewer yoH5)]. Based on the above concerns, the reviewers were not convinced that this work is well supported in its current state to merit acceptance for publication.
","The generalization of data distributions to unseen regions remains one of the critical challenges in machine learning . Machine learning systems often do not share the same inductive biases as humans and, as a result, may extrapolate in ways that do not match analyst's expectations . The proposed protocol, which takes its ideas from psychology, is also interesting . The paper proposes measures of how two types of explanation methods -- rule based and exemplar based -- generalize and extrapolate to unseen data regions .",0.13545816733067728,0.7957451343536377,0.7286987900733948,0.7607476711273193,INCORRECT,0.9929890632629395
