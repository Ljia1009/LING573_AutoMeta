        "This paper addresses a core issue of the popular conditional neural process: the predictions at each test point are conditionally independent given the conditioning set. This is an inappropriate modeling assumption for many real-world datasets. I was disappointed when I found that these weren't used in the paper I think the novelty of the proposed methods is not striking. The proposed method looks like a direct implementation of a Gaussian process with deep kernel learning in the meta learning setting",
        "This paper proposes a class of neural processes that lifts the limitations of conditional neural processes (CNPs) and produces dependent/correlated outputs but that, as CNPs, is inherently scalable and it is easy to train via maximum likelihood. The proposed model is extended to multi-output regression and to capture non-Gaussian output distributions. Results are presented on synthetic data, an electroencephalogram dataset and on a climate modeling problem. The paper parameterizes the prediction map as a Gaussian, where the mean and covariance are determined using neural networks. Non-Gaussian prediction maps are obtained using copulas. \n\nTechnically speaking, the reviewers found the approach to be incremental and only marginally significant and I agree with them. Issues such as estimates of computational cost, using fixed lengthscales for the covariances and relationships/using normalizing flows have been addressed by the authors satisfactorily. Empirically, the contribution of the paper is somewhat significant, as it provides similar flexibility to other more computationally expensive processes and more general assumptions than conditional neural processes.\n\n"

I think the algorithm and analysis are both nice contributions and definitely intend to study the latter further as I think aspects of it may be useful in other settings. Overall the presentation, while dense, is clear. However, there are a few issues that could need additional discussion: 1) Why does the uniqueness of the Nash equilibria not matter to the results? Quite a bit of prior work has had caveats when they are not unique. The results seem to hold if the assumptions are true for at least one equilibrium, presumably because of the minimax properties in a zero -sum setting, but I’m not quite clear",

While an unbiased SMC variant with PRC has been previously introduced by Kudlicka et al. (2020), this work introduces innovations that can help apply such ideas to variational inference. These bounds result in improvements in empirical performance. \n\nThis paper was heavily discussed, with significant engagement by both the authors and the reviewers. Most reviewers recommended acceptance of this paper, with one reviewer (R4) recommending against acceptance. R4's central concerns regard the novelty of the proposed approach and its positioning relative to the existing SMC literature. The authors argued vigorously in the comments that this paper should be judged as a contribution to the VI literature and not the SMC literature.  Unfortunately, I will recommend that this paper is rejected. It is my opinion that R4's concerns were not fully addressed.\n\nOn the one hand, I agree with the authors that there is significant value to be had in exploring variants of SMC for VI. Indeed, some prior art, like FIVO and IWAE, contributed little to the Monte Carlo literature. I believe that these were good contributions.\n\nOn the other hand, I am concerned that the current draft does not clearly circumscribe its contributions. I read the sections that disuss the works of Schmon et al. (2019) and Kudlicka et al. (2020), and the writing did not leave me with a clear enough sense of the differences. I also read the abstract and introduction of the paper. The introduction of the paper positions this work clearly within the VI literature, but does not clearly discuss prior SMC art, e.g., it does not cite Kudlicka et al. (2020). Despite citing rejection control for SMC, the writing of the abstract and introduction left me with the impression that this work was the first to introduce *unbiased, partial* rejection control for SMC. I believe that impressions matter and that the machine learning community should be generous to adjacent communities when assigning credit.\n\nI realize that my decision is a matter of taste. I also want to say that I am confident that the authors have a clear sense of where their contribution sits, and I suspect that it is a valuable contribution. However, I cannot recommend the draft in its current form. If this is a contribution to the VI literature, as the authors argue, then the authors should not hesitate to give full credit to prior SMC art. My reading of the current draft still leaves me confused about which aspects of the SMC estimator are actual contributions.\n\n"

The authors did a good job in trying to answer all questions and concerns of the reviewers. \n\nHowever, some concerns remained:\n- the setting assumes that the OOD data is fixed which was considered as partially unrealistic and thus evaluation of the OOD detection performance on unseen OOD distributions was requested in order to understand the limitations of the method (this was only partially done by the authors). \n- the theoretical result is for a two-layer network and completely based on previous work. As the authors use much deeper networks later on in the experiments, this result cannot be used to theoretically justify the approach. \n- there remained concerns about the necessary diversity of the ensemble and the early stopping procedure\n\nWhile I think that the paper has its merits, it is not yet ready for publication. I encourage the authors to to take into account the above points and other remaining concerns of the reviewers in a revised version.\n\n"

While there are natural fluctuations with respect to the (meta) hyperparameters, a larger number of hyperparameters included usually resulted in a close to optimal AUROC.\n\nAnother concern for two reviewers was the extendability of the efficient ensemble training techniques to other models such as GANs etc. As the authors replied, even though skip connections might not be adaptable to other techniques, e.g. for ensembling various widths, zero-masked layers with BatchEnsemble would also be broadly applicable to ensemble-learn other unsupervised representation learning models. Perhaps in the final version, the authors further discuss with a short experiment how the AE-specific scaling techniques add to the performance.\n\nA further concern was the lack of theoretical underpinning about the (meta)HP-robustness. Given that the reviewers agree that this paper provides ample empirical evidence and praise the experimental value, we think theoretical work (providing HP sensitivity results is highly nontrivial in general, let alone for neural networks) can be part of future work but the lack of it in the current manuscript should not prevent the publication of this work.\n\n"

The novelty of the proposed methods was very well illustrated, and the theorems 1 and 2 provided convincing results of the effectiveness of the suggested method. The motivation of introducing randomized Smoothing into the score function was very good illustrated.",

The observation that point (i) alone lends some robustness to adversarial perturbations of the data is interesting. As several experiments in the paper and responses to reviewers show, this comes at the (apparently necessary) price of larger prediction sets. \n\nI read through all the comments and also the supplement. The authors have responded very well to all the reviewers questions/concerns, adding significant sections to their supplement as a result. Three reviewers are convinced, but one remaining reviewer requested additional experiments to compare with Cauchois et al (in addition to all the others already produced by the authors originally and in response to reviewers). However, the authors point out that the code in the aforementioned paper was not public, but they were able to privately get the code from the authors during the rebuttal period. At this point, I recommend acceptance of the paper even without those additional experiments, since it is not the authors' fault that the original code was not public. Nevertheless, I suggest to the authors that, if possible, they could add some comparisons to the camera-ready since they now have the code.\n\nI congratulate the authors on a nice work, a very solid rebuttal, and also the astute reviewers on pointing out various aspects that could be improved. \n\nMinor point for the authors (for the camera-ready): I would like to comment on the Rebuttal point 4.4 in the supplement, which then got further discussed in the thread.

I think the literature reviews in this area are starting to be messy, and all authors need to do a better job. Clearly, the original paper of Vovk et al already establishes various types of conditional validity (and calls it PAC-style guarantee), produces guarantees that others in this area produce, and it appears that much recreation of the wheel is occurring. For eg, [R2, R4] do not cite [R5], despite [R5] appearing earlier and being published earlier, and having PAC-style guarantees and experiments with neural nets, etc. However, in turn, [R5] do not cite Vovk [R1], but [R2, R4] do cite [R1]. (And [R3] does not seem to be relevant to this discussion of conditional validity?) In any case, I am not sure any of these papers need citing since the current paper does not deal with conditional validity. If at all, just one sentence like \"Conditional validity guarantees, of the styles suggested by Vovk [2012], would be an interesting avenue for future work\".\n\n"

The authors argue in particular that mT5 and KoGPT-2 can benefit from continued pre-training this corpus, which seems satisfactory, although there is the question raised by 7fpy that this is essentially pre-training on the test tasks and may be too generous when assessing the performance on other legal-domain tasks that arise down the road.  Reviewer 7fpy brings up some valid critiques of the dataset construction: several points about filtering were unclear, as was the strength of the automatic pipeline used to construct the dataset.\n\nThere are a few ethical concerns raised by the ethics reviewer, which I believe are serious. Point [1] is resolved. Point [2] about misuse seems valid and harder to argue against.  The data does have value for use in the kind of more benign studies the authors report in the response there. But its very existence could encourage the construction of certain kinds of automated tools for legal judgment prediction, which has been a hotly-debated issue in the NLP community before. Ultimately I will defer to the ethics reviewer on this one, who seems satisfied.\n\nOverall this paper seems like a well-done effort. The main question is whether its utility (modulated by issues with the results) outweighs the risks of putting it out there. Reviewers seem to lean positive on this and I would lean positive as well.\n\n"

The other borderline negative review, by reviewer LkTe, had as their main ciriticism that NAS methods should be benchmarked on many spaces, but the point of tabular NAS benchmarks is *not* to provide a conclusive assessment of the performance of NAS methods that holds in general across search spaces (as a \"horserace\" paper might try to achieve), but rather to facilitate the cheap evaluation of current and future NAS methods on a single search space.

WaveCorr is shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in a portfolio management task.\n\nA major point of discussion was the definition of \"permutation invariance\".  The reviewers and AC understood the difference between the permutation invariance defined in this paper and that studied in the prior work (the output of a network is insensitive to the permutation of the particular values of the input).

Reviewers recognized the practical success of the approach as demonstrated by these empirical results and praised the clarity of the manuscript. However, there were concerns regarding the novelty of the approach and whether the proposed method is simply a composition of previous methods. While I understand these concerns, I think there is a significant delta between this work and previous approaches, especially when taking into account the markedly improved performance and the challenges of determining how to apply these lines of thinking to end-to-end training. The authors also expanded their discussion of these works in their updated manuscript, clarifying the differences. There were also concerns regarding the hyperparameter tuning, but the authors clarified in their response that the large majority of experiments used a constant set of hyperparameters, suggesting that these results are not simply the effect of tuning. Altogether, I think this paper makes an impactful contribution and will be a valuable addition to the conference.\n\n"

        "This paper is about layer-wise training of networks by way of optimizing the IB cost function, which basically measures the compression of the inputs under the constraint that some degree of information with respect to the targets must be preserved. Ziv & Tishby 2017 work and the earlier work on information bottleneck theory of learning (Shwartz et al 1999). This paper provides a method to do explicit IB functional estimation for deep neural networks inspired from the recent mutual information estimation method (MINE)",
        "This paper does two things. First, it proposes an approach to estimating the mutual information between the input, X, or target label, Y, and an internal representation in a deep neural network, L, using MINE (for I(Y;L)) or a variation on MINE (for I(X;L)) and noise regularization (estimating I(X;L+ε), where ε is isotropic Gaussian white noise) to avoid the problem that I(X;L) is infinite for deterministic networks and continuous X. Second, it attempts to validate the information bottleneck theory of deep learning (Tishby and Zaslavsky, 2015) by exploring an approach to training DNNs that optimizes the information bottleneck Lagrangian, I(Y;L) − βI(X;L+ε), layerwise instead of using cross-entropy and backpropagation. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show improvements for the layerwise training over cross-entropy training. The penalty on I(X;L+ε) is described as being analogous to weight decay. The reviewers raised a number of concerns about the paper, the most serious of which is that the claim that the layerwise training results validate the information bottleneck theory of deep learning is too strong. In the AC's opinion, R1's critique that \"[i]f the true mutual information is infinite and the noise regularized estimator is only meant for comparative purposes, why then are the results of the training trajectories interpreted so literally as estimates of the true mutual information?\" is critical, and the authors' reply that \"this quantity is in fact a more appropriate measure for “compactness” or “complexity” than the mutual information itself\" undermines their claim that they are validating the information bottleneck theory of deep nets because the information bottleneck theory claims to be using mutual information. The AC also suggests that if the authors wish to continue this work and submit it to another venue, they (1) discuss the fact that MINE estimates only a lower bound that may be quite loose in practice and (2) say in their experimental section whether or not the variance of the regularizing noise was tuned as a hyperparameter, and if so, how results varied with different amounts of noise. Finally, the AC regrets that only one reviewer participated in the discussion (in a very minimal way), despite the reviewers' receiving several reminders that the discussion is a defining feature of the ICLR review process.\n\n"

These strategies are then applied with appropriate regularization loss ensuring consistency and monotonicity in the training process. Extensive experiments are performed using three popular neural models for KT and four publicly available datasets. Overall, the paper studies an interesting problem in an important application domain of online education. The results are promising and open up several exciting follow-up research directions to explore more complex data augmentation techniques for KT.\n\nI want to thank the authors for actively engaging with the reviewers during the discussion phase and sharing their concerns about the quality of the reviews.

The analysis in this previous paper in some way go further by matching image categories using human evaluators individually for each image -- as pointed out by reviewer dcyB.\n* The dataset was downloaded from a third party's website and as such the authors had no control in how the images were collected, nor there was any effort to enhance this resource in terms of annotations, diversity or size.\n* The dataset size is 38k images which is a rather small dataset for training or enhancing a model, and its use would be limited mostly as a benchmark dataset. As a benchmark however experiments seem limited as pointed by reviewer eAoC. An experiment on training on this dataset and evaluating on this dataset is performed only with a Resnet network, however it is hard to assess what is the significance of this experiment. \n\nThere are various suggestions made by reviewers below that would enhance the quality of this paper.

All results are dependent on the bound being close to the true value. 2) The sample likelihoods are dependent upon a certain \"model\" In the introduction (Cuturi, 2013), the authors mentioned the negative Shannon entropy.",

The authors addressed the issue a) with some new experiments with linear generators and quadratic loss, but it lacks experiments with deep models which seems to be necessary since this is a critical issue.

A key motivation for the proposed model is that it is bringing information and elements for QA (or other reasoning tasks) that purely scaling up language models can not bring. Or maybe they can bring the same kind of improvement but at a much lower computational cost. In any case, this is a very important point to justify the interest of such approach, and neuro-symbolic reasoning overall, empirically.\n\n2/ Using GPT2 (or equivalent): the discussion on using GPT-2 for generating new facts is key too. It is essential to bring this description from appendix to the core of the paper. But more discussion are expected.  For instance, what if GPT-2 generates facts that are false and lead to answering and justifying a wrong answer? In other words, how does it impact the integrity of the contextualized KG?

        "The paper's initial evaluation was below par, but the author feedback helped clarify several crucial points after which two of the reviewers increased their scores by a point, bringing the current evaluation to borderline. \n\nThe paper addresses a relevant and challenging problem in the RL domain. However, in my opinion, from the reviewers' and authors' remarks and from my own reading of the paper, there are concerns that need to be addressed before the paper can be publication worthy. Primary among these is the quantum of novelty -- as many reviews point out, the key idea of viewing an episodic trajectory as a multivariate (vector) sample for running hypothesis tests is not novel in itself, as is the claim that new tests have been devised. Another crucial issue is the (parametric) assumption of normality for the episodic reward sequence which is not adequately justified in the paper -- even a two time-step trajectory with normal rewards per state transition can exhibit a mixture-of-Gaussians type reward distribution for the second state, breaking the assumption. As it transpired from the reviews of Reviewer4, reducing environment shift/degradation to just a mean change problem, without even considering a change in the variances (2nd order statistics), seems to be too stylized to be effective. There are other, nonparametric approaches in statistics based on testing for changes in the distribution function (kernel density estimation approaches, for instance), which could perhaps be applied without normality assumptions and yield favourable results. The experimental results for detection delay often show significant overlaps of the delay distributions for different procedures (e.g., Hotelling vs. Mean vs. UDT etc.), which does not indicate an advantage of the proposed method. \n\nI would urge the author(s) to assimilate the feedback and delve deeper as to why and how parametric procedures based on normality assumptions may or may not succeed, so as to significantly strengthen the theoretical and practical message of this work.  \n\n"

Some automatic metrics or systematic studies of different game categories (shooting, maze-like, and ball-and-paddle) may shed light on the learned attention's general property.\"\n\nR5 says, \"I am still not convinced by the quality of the provided visual explanations nor am I convinced that the attention is well correlated with the current frame (the additional experiments provided do help somewhat in this regard, but are not extensive and reasonably inconclusive\"\n\nIn their rebuttal, to address R1's concern authors suggested that the use of attention on both value and policy networks is novel.

As suggested by reviewers, a systematic study or a human study clearly showing that the proposed method adds more interpretability is critical. However, this is missing.  In response to R3, the authors provided experiments on more games. But this is not the point -- because it's not about the number of environments in which experiments are provided, but rather the nature of the analysis that is performed.

Furthermore, the paper proves that the noise rate for the noise labeled is lower than that of the noisy label label. Hence it can be useful for the ML communities along with this.",
        "The paper's stated contributions are:\n\n(1) a new perspective on learning with label noise, which reduces the problem to a similarity learning (Ie, pairwise classification) task\n\n(2) a technique leveraging the above to learn from noisy similarity labels, and a theoretical analysis of the same\n\n(3) empirical demonstration that the proposed technique surpasses baselines on real-world benchmarks\n\nReviewers agreed that (1) is an interesting new perspective that is worthy of study. In the initial set of reviews, there were concerns about (2) and (3); for example, there were questions on whether the theoretical analysis studies the \"right\" quantity (pointwise vs pairwise loss), and a number of questions on the experimental setup and results (Eg, the computational complexity of the technique). Following a lengthy discussion, the authors clarified some of these points, and updated the paper accordingly.\n\nAt the conclusion of the discussion, three reviewers continued to express concerns on the following points:\n\n- *Theoretical justification*. Following Theorem 3, the authors assert that their results \"theoretically justifies why the proposed method works well\". The analysis indeed provides some interesting properties of the reduction, such as the fact that it preserves learnability (Appendix F), and that the \"total noise\" is reduced (Theorem 2). However, a complete theoretical justification would involve guaranteeing that the quantity of interest (Ie, the clean pointwise classification risk) is guaranteed to be small under the proposed technique. Such a guarantee is lacking. \n  - This is not to suggest that such a guarantee is easy -- as the authors note, this might involve a bound that relates pointwise and pairwise classification in multi-class settings, and such bounds have only recently been shown for binary problems -- or necessary for their method being practical useful (per discussion following Theorem 3). Nonetheless, without such a bound, there are limits to what the current theory justifies about the technique's performance in terms of the final metric of interest.\n\n- *Comparison to SOTA*. Reviewers noted that the gains of the proposed technique are often modest, with the exception of CIFAR-100 with high noise. Further, the best performing results are significantly worse than those reported in two recent works, namely, Iterative-CV and DivideMix. The authors responded to the former in the discussion, and suggested that they might be able to combine results with the latter. While plausible, given that the latter sees significant gains (Eg, >40% on CIFAR-100), concrete demonstration of this point is advisable: it is not immediately apparent to what extent the gains of the proposed technique seen on \"simple\" methods (Eg, Forward) would translate more \"complex\" ones (Eg, DivideMix).\n  - In the response, the authors also mentioned that (at least the initial batch of) the experiments are intended to be a proof-of-concept. This would be perfectly acceptable for a work with a strong theoretical justification. However, per above, this point is not definitive.\n\n- *Creation of Clothing1M*. The authors construct a variant of Clothing1M which merges the classes 3 and 5. Given that prior work compares methods on the original data, and that this potentially reflects noise one may encounter in some settings, it is advisable to at least report results on the original, unmodified version.\n\n- *Issues with clarity*. There are some grammatical issues (Eg, \"is exact the\"), typos (Eg, \"over 3 trails\"), notational inconsistencies (Eg, use of C for # of classes in Sec 2, but then c in Sec 3.1), and imprecision in explanation (Eg, Sec 3.2 could be clearer what precise relationships are used from [Hsu et al. 2019]).\n  - These are minor but ought to be fixed with a careful proof-read.\n\nCumulatively, these points suggest that the work would be served by further revision and review. The authors are encouraged to incorporate the reviewers' detailed comments.\n\n"

        "This paper describes how to use normalizing flows for selecting features in a way that controls the type-1 error by using a normalizing flow along with MCMC to sample from the null distribution. The majority of the reviewers were positive, however the most confident reviewer was negative. From taking a look at that reviewers concerns, I tend to agree with most of them.\n\nThe paper is titled knockoff-free, which means in the context of this paper that both 1) 1-bit p-values are not used and 2) The full knockoff property is not required, only sampling from complete conditionals are required. Most of the experiments compare knockoff methods to the proposed approach, so it's not clear if 1) 1-bit p-values are not great or 2) the model-X process/complete conditional sampling process is better with normalizing flows. The former point is known and the latter point on the best way to sample from the complete conditionals is really the value. \n\nIf we take the paper as, \n\n1) complete conditionals are 1-D\n2) MCMC can be used to sample from a 1-D unnormalized density\n3) Simple MCMC won't be bad because the problem is 1-D\n\n-> Any likelihood based deep generative model can be used to sample complete conditionals\n\nthen it's a solid paper.\n\nOn the other hand, the belief that flows are the correct choice versus other likelihood-based deep generative models is harder to take as there's only a comparison with a mixture density network used in the original HRT paper. Also from other uses of these models, different models are better in different situations. I'd suggest a heavy discussion in the paper on this point at the minimum. Maybe even a reframing of the paper is needed.\n\nFinally, for the test statistic, the HRT may not be the best choice for work like this paper that studies the problems with estimating X-distribution. The  paper \"CONTRA: Contrarian statistics for controlled variable selection\" at AISTATS 2021 shows that the HRT test statistic is more sensitive to model-X estimation errors than a simple mixture statistic that doesn't give up much power. The choice of test statistic also merits some discussion in step 3.\n\n"

These Z-s are inferred from trajectory segments in unlabeled environments. The Z-s are learned contrastively: Z-s from the same trajectory are pulled together, and Z-s from separate trajectories are pushed apart. However, to mitigate the error of distancing Z-s from different trajectories but the same environment, Z-s on trajectories with similar transitions are also pushed together using a soft clustering penalty. These losses are justified based on ideas from Pearl’s causal inference.\n\nSummary of paper discussion:\n\nThe reviewers concluded that the contributions are conceptually interesting and “somewhat” novel.

The \"safe\" is related to the performance, i.e., the performance is guaranteed not to be reduced compared with the baseline supervised learning method. The idea of the paper is clear and sound. The bound on the variance of the DeSSL risk estimate and the generalization bound are useful. They give us generalization insights about SSL, and the benefit from the correlation between $L$ and $H$ on average.",
        "This paper provides an interesting generalized perspective on SSL techniques and proposes a debiasing technique that can be viewed as decreasing the variance of the risk estimate. The authors argue that this leads to estimators that are better than the purely supervised estimator under a rather weak assumption called MCAR - which assumes that the probability of a missing label is independent of covariate and label. \n\nAlthough the exposition and perspective are interesting, this paper is borderline for the following two main reasons:\n\n1. A few reviewers were not convinced of the theoretical result that is supposed to show that unlabeled data strictly helps - indeed, whereas usual variance reduction techniques (e.g for optimization schemes such as SGD etc.) lead to a strict gain in terms of convergence rate, there is no clear asymptotic/high probability statement that indicates statistical gain of the corresponding estimator (which is what we really care about - not the risk estimate). The dependence of lambda_opt on theta (which changes every iteration) does not help in providing such a statement. Since this is the primary contribution of the paper, I would suggest the authors follow through with the analysis to show a gain for the actual estimator compared to the \"complete case\" (only using supervised data). \n\nOn that note, the authors claimed in their rebuttal that they have added an asymptotic variance analysis in Appendix I, which indeed would have made a very valuable point - however, I could only find a copy-pasted version of Theorem 3.1. in Appendix I? Similarly, Appendix F does not seem to include the comparison between debasing using labeled and unlabeled data but instead contains the proof of Theorem 3.2. Perhaps the wrong revision was uploaded, but unfortunately, given the current version, this point is not adequately addressed.\n\n2. If the experimental results were more extensive and conclusive, then the current theorem could have perhaps been alright as a mainly methodological contribution. However, as the authors note, extensive experiments require a lot of compute power - however, given the lack of the ultimate theorem, the methodology becomes the primary contribution and would thus require more experimental evidence as the reviewers asked for.\n  \nAddressing one of the above points would push the paper above the acceptance threshold which we hope the authors can pursue in their next submission. \n\n"

It implements three components to aggregate the obtained patch-level representations: deep attention-based class-specific MIL aggregation(CDA), a positive-negative-aware model that pushes away positive and negative patches given its relevance to the slide-level prediction (PNM) and a weakly-supervised cross-slide contrastive learning with both hard negative and negative sample mining.",
        "This work presents a method to obtain slide level representations in computational pathology. The specific contributions of this work are a positive-negative-aware module (PNM) and a weakly-supervised cross-slide contrastive learning (WSCL) module and a loss to encourage intra-WSI local patch separation and inter-WSI global feature contrast. The idea is to use the attention weights in a MIL framework as patch level pseudo labels. These are used to compute \"weights\" for positive and negative patches (the latter of which is assumed to be significantly larger in number for a given WSI). By using these weights in a contrastive manner to push the representations from positive patches away from those of negative patches, the model learns more effectively since it is less susceptible to the noise from the negative patches.\n\nThe reviewers found these contributions novel. During the review, the largest source of concern was along the choices made during the empirical evaluation. Specifically, the manuscript in its current form lacked empirical backing for several of the choices made regarding the neural architecture, the algorithm for self-supervised learning etc. In response to this the authors conducted several different kinds of ablation studies (which were incorporated into the supplement) during the rebuttal process, which other reviewers found convincing as a potential explanation of the outcomes.\n\nOverall, I found the main contributions of this work (leveraging patch level attention weights as psuedo labels) to be an interesting use case for computational pathology to better focus the learning signal on positive patches. My additional comment is that I think the additional ablation experiments (and references) are an important part of the contributions of this work and should be incorporated into the main paper rather than in the appendix (several equations can be compressed to make space in the manuscript in addition to the additional page). \n\n"

This paper proposes SUNMASK, which models discrete sequences without ordering assumptions. The authors emphasized the fine-grained control during the iterative generation which is very helpful for the readers to understand and potentially reproduce. However, this paper has several major shortcomings. Quantitatively, I think Bach Mock grading function is biased towards its own task, and it is less generaliziliby than BLEU score on the LM task",
        "This paper introduces SUNMASK for modeling discrete sequences. It builds upon previous works such as SUNDAE, Coconet and order-agnostic NADE, but uses a masking scheme that enables fine-grained or human-in-the-loop control during the generation. The qualitative experiments about musical inpainting and masking terms in language modeling do support this motivation to some extent. However, the reviewers are mainly concerned with both the algorithmic novelty and experiments of the paper.\n \nRegarding the algorithmic novelty, some reviewers are concerned that the method is a straightforward combination of SUNMASK and Coconet. I tend to agree with this. Also the reviewers are concerned that the paper could have done a better job in the introduction and background section by putting the method in a better context and better describing related methods such as SUNDAE. This could help highlight the novelty of the paper.\n \nRegarding the experiments, some reviewers are concerned about language modeling (Fig. 2) experiments, and that they do not show much improvement over SUNDAE. I tend to agree, and this is also shown in the results of Table 3 where it is clear that the quality of the language model is not on a par with the recent developments.\n \nAlso some of the motivations of the paper, especially the arguments about \"high trust / low trust\" interpretation of the mask, was unclear to me.\n \nIn short, I believe the paper should be clarified and improved by addressing the above concerns.\n\n"

The second extension allows the RNN to condition on the top stack state as well as the symbol, improving expressiveness.

Each of these requires substantial algorithmic innovations.\n\nThe reviewers all agree that this is a strong paper worthy of publication.

        "### Review ### Summary I am currently leaning towards recommending reject for this paper. While the approach and algorithm are novel, they also appear to be highly complex, don't provide a noticeable or consistent improvement over much simpler benchmarks, and I fear that the improvements that _are_ seen are likely due to variance in the results or are hidden behind the additional machinery in the algorithm. This paper studies an important area in hierarchical RL, which improves data efficiency by incorporating abstractions. In this paper, the authors propose an efficient option learning algorithm, which utilizes a TD(0) type objective and restricts the learned policy being not too far away from the past policy. In terms of different abstractions, the paper studies action abstraction through a mixture policy, and temporal abstraction through explicitly limiting the maximum number of switches between options. The method is well-motivated in general, however, I feel the notation in Al",

The reviews describe in detail what the reviewers would have found compelling, but the key suggestion is to remove the complexity that is not essential for the approach to provide consistent improvements.  Doing this requires a better understanding of the algorithm's behavior and a valid ablation study, a new concern raised during the discussion with the authors. \n\nThe reviewers felt that the proposed approach is potentially interesting and would like to see this paper done well.\n\n"

The authors have provided detailed responses to all reviewers’ comments and concerns and updated their manuscript. The main concerns of those reviewers sitting on the fence seem to be answered and limitations acknowledged however the element of bias in the data collection was still considered as a possible concern. Based on my reading and accounting for the authors changes, there approach itself is novel and original and hence provides already a relevant contribution to NeuroIPS; while the authors acknowledge limitations and future work avenues. The one reviewer recommending rejection didn’t engage in the discussion but from my reading of both the paper, the comments, and the authors responses, I believe the main points were addressed by the authors and misunderstandings clarified. Overall, I believe the papers offers a novel, non-existing dataset that can inspire interesting future works; all the dataset is shared and presented clearly for others to use. \n\n\n"

However, it has several weak points, especially in evaluating the proposed model.",
        "This paper presents Recommender Transformer (RETR) with a pathway attention mechanism that can dynamically zeroing-out the interactions (e.g., the trivial/noisy ones) in transformer-based sequential recommender systems. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. \n\nOverall this paper received mixed reviews with borderline scores. The reviewers raised concerns around baselines and evaluations, some of which the authors promptly addressed in the revision during the rebuttal period. I also read the paper in details myself. I do agree with some of the concerns from the reviewers but I don't think a method needs to beat every other published papers to be published (and I think the current baselines are more than thorough enough). My biggest complaint about the paper is around the writing, specifically, how the proposed idea is presented. \n\nThis paper tries to tackle an important question, which is that in sequential recommendation, not every interactions are useful in helping predict future interaction. The self-attention mechanism in transformer kind of addresses this problem but in a more \"softer\" fashion with attention weights. This paper presents a simple yet effective method to introduce a pathway mechanism that adaptively zeroing-out some of the interactions via a binary pathway router. In order to train such a model end-to-end, Gumbel-softmax sampling is utilized.\n\nThe most important part of the contribution to me is that this is an improvement to the transformer architecture, as opposed to a new model which is what this paper's writing suggests -- the proposed approach is effectively model-agonistic and doesn't marry to a particular loss function or finer-grained architectural choices (number of layers, etc.). Currently there are many baselines in the paper, but each made some different model/architecture choices, which could contribute to the difference in performance (or not, but we wouldn't know). An ideal evaluation should have been to take all the transformer-based baselines that are currently in the paper, add this pathway mechanism without changing anything else, and show that the results improved over the transformer architecture. In this way, we know the improvements are exactly coming from introducing the pathway. The authors might argue some of the current results are already supporting this argument, but my point is to emphasize this point very explicitly rather than leaving it for the readers to infer. \n\nFrom what I read in this paper, I truly believe this pathway idea has its potential. Therefore, I would especially want the authors to further refine the presentation to better convey the idea, which in turn will hopefully increase the impact of this paper once it is eventually published. \n\nSome minor comments:\n* The way the paper is currently written seems to suggest there are only three types of pathways and the network is capable of capturing all of them. I am personally not a big of fan of over-interpreting what a neural net is trying to do. Therefore, I wouldn't overly focus on the characterization of different pathways and only show the qualitative examples at the end as a high-level demonstration.\n* In Eq 2 \"softmax\" should really be \"sigmoid\" if a 0-1 prediction is made there. Then the following line \"logit\" is probably not the right word here. \n* The qualitative examples at the end (figure 3) can be more carefully examined/labeled. For example, the current categorization is quite ambiguous -- \"Indie\" refers to the type of developers while \"JPG\" refers to the genre of the game, they are certainly not mutually exclusive.  \n\n"

        "The reviewers have improved their scores after the rebuttal, and I agree that the work has value. It proposes a model-driven data augmentation approach to environment-invariant graph representation. Just like most data augmentation works in graph representation learning, the approach relies on graph proposal generator. The work has an implicit mechanism hidden in the graph generator (the authors' reply to a reviewer that \"we target the extrapolation via a new invariant learning approach that is agnostic to specific GNN models\" is a misunderstanding of why & how these types of methods work). The submission could significantly improve the introduction by properly describing the work w.r.t. other OOD efforts in graph representation learning. While the tasks of different works may be different (e.g., graph classification vs node classification), it is important to emphasize what each different approach brings to the table (rather than just state that the tasks are different). I hope the authors take this opportunity to improve the introduction. This work is more similar to the former OOD graph representation works than IRM & REX, since (without modeling assumptions) both IRM and REX require the support of the environments in test to be a subset of the ones in training. The present work does not need this support assumption since it uses an implicit mechanism in the graph generator.\n\nThe toy example in Section 3.1 is informative, thank you. The theory looks solid and easy to understand. The technical novelty is limited, since once the input graph has been decomposed into a set of ego-graphs the definitions, formulations, and theory are all straightforward adaptations from the respective versions for IID data. \n\nMinor:\n- In Assumption 2, m() should be defined inside the assumption.\n\n"

First, if I understand correctly, the structure of PDM is very similar to LSGM mentioned in the related work. I guess it can produce better distribution coverage than typical linear diffusions.",
        "This paper presents a simple approach called PDM for composing non-linear and complex normalizing flows with score-based generative models. Since score-based models can be considered as a special form of continuous-time normalizing flows, PDM corresponds to a composition of different classes of normalizing flows. \n\nPros: \n* Combining generic normalizing flows with score-based models is an interesting direction as they have different characteristics and can be complementary to each other.\n* Using Ito's lemma to show that the model learns a non-linear SDE in data space is valuable. \n* The authors show that the variational gap can be reduced using normalizing flows.\n\nCons: \n* The proposed method does not exhibit a clear advantage compared to the diffusion baseline without the normalizing flow component. On the CIFAR10 dataset, the best NLL and FID results are obtained by the diffusion baseline.\n\n* Theorem 2 makes a very unrealistic assumption that a flow network is flexible enough to transform $p_r$ to any arbitrary distribution. If this holds, we wouldn't need the score-based generation model anymore. We could simply train the normalizing flow to map the input data distribution to a Normal distribution.\n\n* This submission chooses to discuss differences with the recent LSGM framework. However, in doing so, several inaccurate claims are made. The lack of inference data diffusion in LSGM is mentioned as one of its drawbacks. However, it is not clear what is the value of having such a mechanism and what implications it may have on the expressivity of the model. Note that mapping from data space to latent space in VAEs can be considered as a stochastic inversion rather than an exact inversion. Ito's lemma does not require invertibility and it can be easily applied to the forward and generative diffusion in LSGM. The authors argue that applying it to the forward diffusion in LSGM will result in $\\hat{p_{r}}\\ne p_{r}$. But, $\\hat{p_{r}}$ would be only considered for visualization of the forward diffusion and it is not used for training or any other purposes. LSGM, the proposed PDM, and score-based models are all trained with a reweighting of ELBO (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02808)). It is not clear if the drawback mentioned above has an impact on the training or expressivity of the model.\n\n* The presentation in the paper requires improvement. The motivation on why invertibility plays a key role is not clear beyond generating the visualization in Figure 2. \n\nIn summary, the paper proposes an interesting idea and explores directions very relevant to the current focus in generative learning. However, given the concerns above, we don't believe that the paper in its current form is ready for presentation at ICLR.\n\n"

This use case could either be of practical use (e.g. potentially useful in an application), or of interest from the point of view of cognitive plausibility (e.g. similar to how children actually learn, and inspired by cognitive science literature).\n\nA concern that offshoots from this is that because the underlying idea is compelling (some sort of grounding to inform language learning), a paper at a high-profile conference such as ICLR may help re-popularize this line of research, which has been a niche for a while.

However, if the task used in this paper, which is of questionable value and reality, becomes the benchmark for this line of work I think this might lead other follow-up work in the wrong direction.

Neither the reviewers nor myself were particularly convinced by the authors' reply on this point. However, this can also be seen as an \"equilibrium refinement\" result, i.e., for a given value of $\\tau$ only certain equilibria can be stable.

        "I like the insight that method can use the model's predictions and gradients and thus we should be aware of model gradient errors. However in practice, we do not know the gradients on the trajectories that we attain and equation (12) requires computing the n-nearest points of $x$ in the replay buffer to estimate the model gradient. This seems potentially intractable in practice for large replay buffers, and seems like it will not always coincide with the true model gradient",
        "The paper considers model-based RL, and focuses on approaches that benefit from the differentiability of the model in order to compute the policy gradient. It theoretically shows that the error in the gradient of the model w.r.t. its input appears in an upper bound of the error in the policy gradient computing using the learned model. Motivated by this, it suggests a MBRL approach that learns two models, one of them minimizes the next-state prediction error (as commonly done) and the other minimizes a combination of prediction error and the gradient error. \nThe paper empirically studies the method through extensive experiments.\n\nReviewers are generally positive about this work. They believe that the paper is insightful and the method is original. At first, there were some important concerns raised by the reviewers, but the authors revised their paper in the discussion period, and it appears that the reviewers are all satisfied now. I also read the paper during the rebuttal phase, and I should say that I have some concerns myself, especially on the theory part of the paper. Given that the authors did not have an opportunity to answer my questions, I do not put much weight on my concerns (and I believe most of them can be addressed with some clarifications). Considering the positive response of reviewers and promising results, I am going to recommend **acceptance** of this paper.\n\nI strongly encourage the authors to consider the comments by reviewers, as well as the following ones, in the revision of their paper.\n\n\n**Comments**\n\n1) The true dynamics $f$ is defined as a stochastic one, i.e., $s_{t+1} = f(s_t, a_t, \\epsilon_t)$ (just before Eq. 1), and similarly for the learned model. Here $\\epsilon_t$ is the noise causing the stochasticity of the model. But later, when the errors on the model and its gradient are introduced (i.e., $\\epsilon_f$ and $\\epsilon_f^g$), the role of stochasticity becomes unclear.\nFor example, we have\n$\\|| \\tilde{f}(s,a) - f(s,a) \\||  \\leq \\epsilon_f$.\n\nWhat happened to the noise term?\n\nThe same is true for Eq. (5). The next-state s' (either according to the true dynamics or the learned model) is random. In that case, it is not obvious how to interpret Eq. (5). Is it the error of the expected gradient of the next state? Or is it something else?\n\nIn case the dynamics is assumed to be deterministic, this should be clarified early in the paper.\n\n2) The upper bound in Theorem 1 might be vacuous if the Lipschitz constant $L_f$ of the model is larger than 1.\nTo see this, consider Lemma 1. The constant $C_0$ is $\\min [D/\\epsilon_f, (1-L_f^{t+1})/(1 - L_f)]$.\nIf $L_f$ is larger than 1, for large enough t, the term $(1-L_f^{t+1})/(1 - L_f)$ blows up and $C_0$ becomes $D/\\epsilon_f$. Therefore, the upper bound of Lemma 1 becomes $D$. Here $D$ is the diameter of the state space, which is assumed to be bounded.\n\nThis carries to in the next lemmas. In Lemma 4, $C_5$ would be of the same order as $C_0$ (multiplied by an extra $L_1 L_f / (1 - \\gamma) )$, so the upper bound of this lemma becomes proportional to D too.\n\nThe $C_0$'s appearance continues in the proof of Theorem 1, in which $C_8$ is proportional to $C_0$ and $C_5$. So, $C_8$ is also become proportional to $D/\\epsilon_f$. When we have $C_8 \\epsilon_f$ in Eq. (34), we get a constant term $D$.\nA similar dependence appears in the proof of Theorem 2, where B_3 is proportional to $C_8 \\epsilon_f$, which can be as large as $D$. And in Eq. (47), we have $B_3^2$. So the upper bound in Eq. (47), which seems to the be upper bound of Theorem 2, is proportional to $D^2$. This means that if $L_f$ is larger than one, the upper bound does not go to zero, no matter how small the model error $\\epsilon_f$ is (unless it is actually zero). This makes the bound meaningless.\n\nThis might be unavoidable. I am not sure about it at the moment. But it definitely requires a discussion.\n\n3) Assumption 2 has a term in the form of $E[\\frac{s_{t_2}}{ s_{t_1}} ]$ (I have simplified the form). The states $s_{t_2}$ and $s_{t_1}$ are vectors in general. How is the division defined here?\n\n4) Please improve the clarify of the proofs. For example, in Lemma 2 it seems that a negative sign is missing in Eq. (49). Also how do we get Eq. (50) and Eq. (52)? (I couldn't easily verify them).\n\n5) I believe the \"periodicity property\" used in Assumption 1 should be \"ergodicity property\".\n\n6) The paper still has a lot of typos, e.g., \"To optimize the objective, One can ...\" (P3), \"argument data\" (instead of augmented) (p4), \"Superpose\" (p5), \"funcrion\" (p6).\n\n"

However, I disagree with the attritue that the comparison on 1 language is sufficient given the recent progress of code summariziton. As the proposed approach is mainly justified by empirical comparison, conducting results on a limited dataset raises the concern whether the proposed approach is generalizble to other languages and datasets. It also makes future work harder to compare with this work. I especially disagree the point that some earlier papers only compared on limited datasets. These papers are published earlier than the benchmark CodeXGlue has been released. As most recent baselines are compared on CodeXGlue, there is a need to justify the missing of results on this dataset. Besides, the argument of the dataet is noisy the performance is low do not seem rigorous and reasonable to me.\n\n3. Human evaluation.

Is sensor mismatch between human and autonomous vehicles the actual problem for learning? Do self-driving cars even utilize a policy formulation explored in the HOIL paper? How big are these state / support mismatches in practice, and couldn't they be mitigated by simpler methods? This paper is the first I've heard suggested that sensor mismatch between humans and autonomous vehicle sensors is the bottleneck for performance. If we remove this motivation from the paper and only consider the importance weighting algorithm used for removing out of distribution examples, then it doesn't feel quite as novel as there are many works that propose some kind of distribution-projection step as a way to mitigate state marginal differences between teachers and learners (e.g. CQL). \n\nIn fact, the setting (1) is not only avoided, but actively exploited by some learning papers (Asymmetric Actor Critic, Guided Policy Search, and other ideas) to *boost* the sample efficiency of learning, with the idea that the asymmetry in state support allows experts to provide useful learning signal in a way that the learner cannot adversarially overfit easily. \n\nFrom reviewer pD56, \n```\nI didn't find the authors' response to be particularly convincing (the self-driving example doesn't seem like a good fit for what they're doing, and I think they're conflating differences in perceptual accuracy with differences in sensing hardware).\n```\n\n\n"

        "## Description\nThe paper discovers interesting phenomena in training neural networks with binary weights:\n- Connection between latent weight magnitude and how important its binarized version for the network performance\n-training dynamics, indicating that large latent weights are identified and stabilize early on\n- Observation that amongst learned binary kernel, several specific patterns prevail, up to the bits who's reversal has very little effect. This is so regardless of the architecture, the layer considered or the dataset. \nThe paper further demonstrates how these observations may be used to compress binary neural networks below 1 bit per weight.\n\n## Review Process and Decision\nThe reviewers welcomed the experimental investigation of new phenomena, but commented the overall technical quality of the work as somewhat substandard. The redundancy of consecutive affine transforms is known and not connected to binary weights investigation. The investigation itself lacks a more in-depth analysis. The proposed compression results appeared not convincing to reviewers since a significant drop of accuracy occurs. The AC shares these concerns and supports rejection.\n\n## General Comments\nFrom my perspective, the study undertaken is methodologically „wrong“. An ad-hoc training method is investigated, which is not even clearly defined in the paper (there are many „STE“ variants) and for which it is not known what it is doing, what are the real-valued weights for and whether they are needed at all (as empirically argued by Helwegen et al. (2019)). As such, the investigation makes impression of poking a black box (the training method in this case). At the same time, there are more clear learning formulations, applicable in the setting of the paper (binary weights), in particular considering the stochastic relaxation:\n* Shayer et al. (2017): Learning Discrete Weights Using the Local Reparameterization Trick\n* Roth et al. (2019): Training Discrete-Valued Neural Networks with Sign Activations Using Weight Distributions\n* Peters et al. (2018): Probabilistic binary neural networks\n\nThese methods are approximate, but at least the optimization is well posed and it is known what do the real-valued weights represent (e.g. logits of binary weight probabilities).\nFrom this perspective, it can be seen that latent weights close to 0 correspond to Bernoulli weights that are almost fully random (and thus only contribute noise) and are fragile to gradient steps. Therefore the model can only perform well if it learns to be robust to their state or their state becomes more deterministic (corresponding to large latent weight). So one would actually expect to see in these models phenomena similar to the observed in the paper and not bee too much surprised or astonished by them. Furthermore, there are recent works explaining STE and its latent weights as optimizing the stochastic relaxation:\n* Meng et al. (2020): Training Binary Neural Networks using the Bayesian Learning Rule\n* Yanush et al. (2020): Reintroducing Straight-Through Estimators as Principled Methods for Stochastic Binary Networks. \n\nThe authors are encouraged to make the observed phenomena more explainable by connecting to the mentioned works.\n\n## Further Details\n\n*  „We show that in the context of using batch normalization after convolutional layers, adapting scaling factors with either hand-crafted or learnable methods brings marginal or no accuracy gain to final model.“\n\nFrom theoretical perspective, this is obvious and known to me. Practically, there could be in principle some difference due to the learning dynamics, and verifying that there is none is a useful but a weak contribution. The section devoted to this issue can be given in the appendix but is not justified in the main paper.\n\n* „change of weight signs is crucial in the training of BWNs“\n\nThe sign determines the binary weights, so this is by definition.\n\n* „ Firstly, the training of BWNs demonstrates the process of seeking primary binary sub-networks whose weight signs are determined and fixed at the early training stage, which is akin to recent findings on the lottery ticket hypothesis for efficient learning of sparse neural networks“\n\nIn the lottery ticket hypothesis paper it is shown explicitly that the identified sparse subnetwork changes during the learning the most rather than retains its initialization state or the state in the beginning of the training. It is therefore could be of a different nature.\n\n\n"

For instance, Li et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04092.pdf) already proposed a model consisting of pre-trained Transformer encoders and decoders. The paper studies a research question that is at the heart of representation learning, which could potentially be very impactful. The model is evaluated on disentanglement of semantic roles and shows its ability to identify semantic roles",
        "This paper proposes improving human interpretability and manipulability of neural representations by obtaining syntactic roles (here, subject, object, prepositional object, and main verb) without supervision by means of them becoming linked to latent variables in a novel proposed attention-driven VAE (ADVAE) model, which provides cross attention between a language transformer and latent variables. The paper argues that syntactic roles are quite central to meaning interpretation and that the ADVAE recovers them better than LSTM or Transformer (with mean pooling) VAEs.\n\nThis is a quite interesting direction and paper. There was active discussion with the reviewers, one of whom (9pDc) moved their rating from reject to quite strong support, while the other reviewers either sat on the fence or raised from reject to borderline. Nevertheless, I overall tend to agree that the paper is still lacking in empirical support, a view clearly shared by reviewers WuPD and 7uFL. The SNLI data is very simple descriptive sentences, nearly all in the form of S V O or S V PP. Would this work on more complex data, in other languages, or with more word order variation? There isn't very much investigation, but the new results added during reviewing based on Yelp data seem to offer more concerns than confidence. These are also very short sentences but with more varied structure and some complementation. It seems like D_{dec} is now very low (much lower than for the sequence VAE), the ability to distinguish out grammatical roles seems limited to {subj} vs. {dobj, pobj} in the encoder and none at all in the decoder (Figure 6/7). And then for the examples in Appendix D, the disentanglement abilities barely seem stronger than being able to pick out subjects, though when there are sentences with subordinate clauses, it is perhaps random which subject you get. The resampled realizations in appendix H also seem to show limited disentanglement: resampling the subject usually seems to change the object as well, often markedly. No convincing downstream applications are shown. As such, while I agree that disentanglement is at the heart of representation learning, I can't get on board with reviewer 9pDc feeling that this paper now has convincing results. Reviewer 7uFL also emphasizes that there is no strong reason that the latent variables have to align with syntactic roles. In particular, the motivation in NMT whereby constituents clump and reorder together does not exist here. It may only work for the very simple and regular sentences of SNLI.\n\nHence, overall, I feel that this method needs more extensive validation on harder, more varied data sets before it becomes a convincing contribution, and so I propose rejecting the paper at this point in time. Nevertheless, I do think the topic is interesting and this approach has the potential to be good.\n\n"

However, the experimental results cannot fully validate the authors’ claims.",
        "### Paper summary \nThis paper investigates theoretically and empirically the effect of increasing the number of parameters (\"overparameterization\") in GAN training. By analogy to what happens in supervised learning with neural networks, overparameterization does help to stabilize the training dynamics (and improve performance empirically). This paper provides an explicit threshold for the width of a 1-layer ReLU network generator so that gradient-ascent training with a linear discriminator yields a linear rate of convergence to the global saddle point (which corresponds to the empirical mean of the generator matching the mean of the data). The authors also provides a more general theorem that generalizes this result to deeper networks.\n\n### Evaluation\nThe reviewers had several questions and concerns which were well addressed in the rebuttal and following discussion, in particular in terms of clarifying the meaning of \"overparameterization\". After discussing the paper, R1, R2 and R4 recommend acceptance while R3 recommends rejection. The main concern of R3 is that the GAN formulation analyzed in the paper is mainly doing moment matching between the generator  distribution (produced from a *fixed* set of latent variables z_i) and the empirical mean of the data. R3 argues that this is not sufficient to \"understanding the training of GANs\". At least two aspects are missing: how the distribution induced by the generator converges according to other notion of divergence (like KL, Wasserstein, etc.); and what about the true generator distribution (not just its empirical version from a fixed finite set of samples z_i)? While agreeing these are problematic, the other reviewers judged that the manuscript was useful first step in understanding the role of overparameterization in GANs and thus still recommend acceptance. And importantly, this paper is the first to study this question theoretically.\n\nI also read the paper in more details. I have a feeling that some aspects of this work were already developed in the supervised learning literature; but the gradient descent-ascent dynamic aspect appears novel to me and the important question of the role of overparameterization here is both timely, novel and quite interesting. I side with R1, R2 and R4: this paper is an interesting first step, and thus I recommend acceptance. See below for additional comments to be taken in consideration for the camera ready version.\n\n### Some detailed comments\n- Beginning of section 2.3: please be clearer early on that you will keep V fixed to a random initialization rather than learning it. The fact that this is standard in some other papers is not a reason to not be clear about it.\n- Theorem 2.2: in the closed form of the objective when $d$ is explicitly optimized, we are back to a more standard supervised learning formulation, for example (5) could look like regression. The authors should be more clear about this, and also mention in the main text that the core technical part used to prove Theorem 2.2 is from Oymak & Soltanolkotabi 2020 (which considers supervised learning). This should also a bit more clear in the introduction -- it seems to me that the main novelty of the work is to look at the gradient-descent dynamic, which is a bit different than the supervised learning setup, even though some parts are quite related (like the full maximization with respect to $d$).\n- p.6 equation (8): typo -- the  $-\\mu d_t$ term is redundant and should be removed as already included from $\\nabla_d h(d,\\theta)$.\n- p.7 \"numerical validations\" paragraph: Please describe more clearly what is the meaning of \"final MSE\". Is this a global saddle point (and thus shows the limit of the generator to match the empirical mean), or is this coming from slowness of convergence of the method (e.g. after a fixed number of iterations, or according to some stopping criterion?). Please clarify.\n\n\n"

In particular, during the discussion phase the reviewers were not able to decipher the algorithm based on the description presented in the paper. It is not clear how the problem is modeled as a bandit problem, what the loss function $\\ell$ is minimized and why minimizing it makes sense (assuming, e.g., that $\\ell$ it the hinge loss as suggested and the initial prediction is good with a large margin, that is, the loss is zero, equation 6 never changes $x_t$ when the procedure is started from $x$). This connection, since it is the fundamental contribution of the paper, should be much better explained. Once the problem is set up to estimate (maximize?) the reward, it is changed to calculating the difference in the minimization (cf. equation 11), which is again unmotivated. (Other standard aspects of the algorithm should also be explained properly, e.g., the stopping condition of Algorithm 1)\n\nUnfortunately, the paper is written in a mathematically very imprecise manner. As an example, consider equation (6), where $B_p$ and the projection operator are not defined, and while these can be guessed, a projection of the argmin seems to be missing as well in the end (otherwise nothing guarantees that $x_T$, which is the final outcome of the algorithm, remains in the $L_p$ ball). Another example is the $Discrete\\ Approximate\\ CorrAttack_{Flip}$ paragraph which requires that every coordinate of $x$ should be changed by  $\\pm\\epsilon$. It is also not clear what \"dividing the image into several blocks\" means in Section 4.1 (e.g., are these overlapping, do they cover the whole image, etc., not to mention that previously $x$ was a general input, not necessarily an image). It is also unlikely that the stopping condition in Algorithm 1 would use the exact same $\\epsilon$ for the acquisition function as the perturbation radius for adversarial examples, etc. While some of these inaccuracies and unclear definitions are also mentioned in the reviews, unfortunately there are more in the paper.\n\nThe authors are encouraged to resubmit the paper to the next venue after significantly improving and cleaning up the presentation.\n\n\n\n"

I think it would be worth discussing how the analysis of this paper relates to this empirical phenomenon. In particular, it would be worth clarifying in what regimes the suboptimality of training from a dataset with noisy examples arises and how likely this is to effect the mean value of the learned policy (for context, it is fairly common in practice to evaluate the student policy in BC settings by only using the mean action value; perhaps this point was present in the paper, and I missed it). From a certain perspective, the innovation of this paper is to accentuate the clean-up effect.\n\nAs noted by a reviewer, and subsequently incorporated into the paper, the actual algorithm has some similarities to versions of recent \"offline RL\" algorithms (though of course it does not leverage rewards).  In particular, the motif of performing a weighted regression could perhaps be a bit more thoroughly contextualized by connecting it to other weighting factors (e.g. see Critic Regularized Regression).  That said, I leave this entirely to the discretion of the authors.\n\nThe final scores were 8, 7, & 6.  I see this as a strong paper and will endorse it for a spotlight.\n\n"

Experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and two PhC datasets and the results show that the model with the additional branch can outperform the corresponding baselines. The story and the title are somewhat overclaiming. The authors bring the definition of equivariance in the introduction; however, can the authors be more specific what is the $T'_g$ in their framework? I do not see any post transformation on top of the model output on the newly added branch but just labels. ImageNet distribution, then eqn. (2) is a loss.",
        "This paper proposes an extra loss to add on top of the contrastive learning. The contrastive learning seek representations invariant to transformation, while the extra loss the authors proposed encourage representations to be equivariant to the transformation (i.e. retain information about transformation in later representations). While reviewers and I agree this is a sensible motivation, and acknowledge good results that authors have obtained, the fact that most, if not all, improvement is combing from the 4-way rotation transformation is a bit unsatisfactory. Furthermore, this additional loss was proposed before and is actually quite well known, so the actual novelty in the proposed technique is somewhat limited. Nevertheless, this paper provides a comprehensive evaluation, obtaining a reasonable improvement, and makes a good case for using an equivariant seeking loss. The authors are strongly encouraged to release their code (including training details for reproducing ImageNet results) as the improvements they present are central to the acceptance.\n\n"

Three types of feedback, i.e. success detection, passive and active scene descriptions, are expressed in language to show how they improve the success rate for planning in simulated and real-world domains. This work extends prior algorithms for robotic planning with LLMs to incorporate feedback, which increases tasks success rate in presence of imperfect low-level control and a dynamic environment.",

Central to the approach is querying the LLM given the instruction and text prompts capturing success of skill execution and a description of the scene. \n\nThis is a systems oriented paper demonstrating and evaluating the utility of a LLM for interleaved planning and execution. The paper is well organised and clearly written. The results highlight the utility of LLMs to enable task execution before an explicit learning of a task model (given primitive robot skills amenable to composition). Further, experiments demonstrate contextual plan adaptation and success goal reaching for simulated and real data sets. \n\nThe main limitation of the work was observed to be the specialised nature of feedback prompts necessary for successful task execution. A clarification was sought if the proposed system has a principled way to determining the necessary feedback and to what extent the feedback is to be adjusted for long-running plans. In response, the authors clarified that the feedback is not hand crafted. Further,  the authors articulated their contribution towards demonstrating  the ability of LLM-based planners to integrated multi-modal feedback without focusing on the specific problem of determine how much or how best such a feedback may be generated. In response to a reviewer’s suggestion, the authors provided a comparison of models with and without feedback with an increase in the task horizon. \n\nAdditionally, the reviewers inquired the degree to which plan recovery is possible in the proposed framework. In response, the authors drew attention to results where plan adaptation occurs when an object falls is no longer in the reachable workspace. The reviewers further requested for a comparison with a baseline that searches over a set of high-candidate plans. As suggested, the authors provided a comparison with a Next Best Decoding that uses the next most likely skill. \n\nOverall, the inclusion of new experimental insights strengthens the paper.

Thus, the method looks easy to adopt and has solid analysis on variance reduction. The authors focus on reducing the variance of the functions parameterizing the variational distribution of each layer using a layer-wise smoothing operator based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup (parameterized by a parameter $rho$). epsilon_1$ has a very small probability of a 1-ep = z_i-1$; in the complement set $mu_i-2$, it is possible to achieve a low KL in the original ELBO, by using an $mi_i+1$ which only has sensible values in the",

The method is interesting and novel, the experiments are well executed, and the authors answered satisfactorily to most of the reviewers' concerns. However, there is one remaining issue that would require additional discussion. As identified by Reviewer 1, the analysis in Section 3 is only valid when the number of layers is 2. Above that value, \"it is possible to construct models where the ELBO has a reasonable value, but the smoothed objective behaves catastrophically\". Thus, the scope of the analysis in Section 3 deserves further discussion. Given the large number of ICLR submissions, this paper unfortunately does not meet the acceptance bar.

        "In this paper, the authors use a GP classifier to detect if the output of a NN classifier has been decided correctly. The GP takes as input the original input vector x and the output of the NN, i.e. the calibrated posterior probabilities given by the NN. It uses that as an input vector for the GP classifier to decide if the sample was correctly decided. The output of the GP will serve as confidence in the output of the NN. The results are comparable/superior with the state-of-the-art and the authors have repeated the experiments with over 125 different datasets. The reviewers of this paper were all cautiously positive about the paper, but all of them pointed towards the reduced novelty of the paper. Also, none of the reviewers were willing to champion this paper as a must-have at ICLR 2021.\n \nFor my reading of the paper, I would tend to agree with the reviewers’ comments. Also, I find that using the same NN, rather shallow, with the same configuration for all the datasets seems rather limited. Given that this method is independent of the underlying classifier and that the databases used are low dimensions and a low number of training examples, I would have liked to see what a random forest or a GP can accomplish. Also, I would have used bigger NNs that can be trained to overfit the sigmoid outputs for classification of higher accuracy. I believe that having a diversity of underlying classifiers is more relevant than having 125 datasets. We need to find the best classifier or ensemble and then apply the different mechanisms for estimating if the output is the correct one. Otherwise, the proposed method might only be workable for this specific NN configuration. In the tables, it can be hinted that this might be happening, as about 80% of the cases MCP and RED are indistinguishable in the AUROC values.\n \nAlso, for all of these datasets a GP could be used as an underlying classifier, and given the premises of this paper, the authors could check how well calibrate a GP classifier is. Also, there has been considerable work on calibrating NNs when they are trained to overfit. Comparing with those methods should be straightforward, as they provide more information than just a confidence score. This is probably the most influential paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04599 (1000+ references), but there are some recent papers too.  \n \nFinally, if the goal is to use a GP to detect if the classification done by the NNs is accurate, using a GP might be an overkill, as the complexity of the GP, especially for large datasets might end up being larger than the underlying classifier.\n\n\n"

Empirically, it demonstrates that such gap (soft-error) is small in supervised image classification for typical deep learning model architectures. However, the main claim of the paper is a pure experimental claim. This paper defines a metric of generalization gap between the ideal world and real world via 'bootstrap approximation', and seeks to use his gap to explain some phenomena.",
        "The paper is proposing a new framework for understanding generalization in the deep learning. The main idea is considering the difference of stochastic optimization on a population risk and optimization on an empirical risk. The classical theory considers the difference of empirical risk and population risk. This basically translates the practical motivation from finding good function classes to finding good optimizers which can re-use the data effectively. Although the paper provides no theoretical result, it provides an interesting empirical study. The paper somewhat demonstrates that SGD on deep networks is somehow good at re-using the same data. I believe this angle is very novel and might hope to future theoretical discoveries. The paper is reviewed by four reviewers and two of them argue its acceptance and two of them argue rejection. After discussion, this status remained and I carefully read and reviewed the paper. Here are the major issues raised by the reviewers:\n\n- R#1: The paper is missing a theoretical study. The implications on the practical deep learning is not clear.\n- R#2: Choice of the soft-error is particular to the task and how to go beyond soft-max is not clear.\n- R#3: Finds the paper not novel as well as trivial or hard to understand.\n- R#4: The choice of soft error is ad-hoc.\n\nI believe the issues raised by R#3 are not justified. First of all, novelty is very clear and. appreciated by other reviewers. Moreover, the paper is rather easy to understand and the results are very farm from trivial. However, the other issues raised by other reviewers are valid. Specifically, soft-error seems to be a limitation of the study. However, the authors respond to this concern and reviewer increases their score. I believe the theory is lacking but the paper is simply showing this novel approach and its empirical validity. A theory to explain this phenomenon would be amazing but not necessary for publication. Similarly, without a theory it is hard to expect any practical implication. Overall, I believe the paper is an interesting and novel one which will likely to lead additional work in the area. Considering we are still far from a satisfying theory of generalization for deep learning and the role of the optimization is clear, this angle worth sharing with the community. Hence, I decide to accept. However, I have some concerns which should be addressed by the camera-ready. \n\n- Claims should be revised and authors should make sure they have enough evidence for them. For example, authors provide no satisfying evidence for random labels or very limited evidence for pre-training. I strongly recommend authors to either remove some of these discussions or present in a fashion which is not a result but part of the discussion for future research.\n- A section about limitations should be added. Specifically, the soft-error choice should be discussed in this limitation section.\n- Discussion section should be extended with the pointers to the relevant work on bootstrap literature as well as suggestions to the theoreticians. Not providing any theoretical result is always fine but authors should understanding why is it hard to make theoretical statements and where to search them.\n\n"

Unfortunately in the literature there are highly cited papers where model selection is not performed in a proper way and reviewers very often reject papers just looking at numbers without looking at how the numbers were obtained.

It uses a discriminator trained to distinguish between random vs. good architectures, letting the discriminator's scores serve as a reward signal for an autoregressive generator. I agree with AR1: this is a nice and clever idea. Reviewers generally agreed that the method was interesting, e.g. it's quite flexible in that it's able to incorporate constraints, and that the evaluation is rather extensive and shows that the method performs well across the board. Many minor criticisms were raised and addressed well by the authors in their responses and manuscript updates.\n\nThe major criticism shared by most reviewers was the high methodological complexity of the proposed approach, and the proportionally small gains shown over much simpler baselines. This criticism remained despite the authors' responses. The method is indeed complex: the same method without any adversarial component already performs well, and many important details of the model are relegated to Appendix A.2. (I would recommend, for example, moving Fig. 2 to the main text if at all possible. Also, the Appendix can/should be included in the main PDF for ICLR, rather than in supplementary material, as AR1 mentions.) It was not clear to reviewers that the adversarial component of the approach has a significant benefit. The authors respond by pointing to Table 7 showing that the discriminator reduces the number of queries and points out that in reality these queries correspond to expensive evaluations. If this is a major selling point of the method (it sounds like it could be), it should be highlighted and analyzed far more -- at least moved to the main text rather than an Appendix -- ideally with a real-world evaluation showing a practical large improvement in overall wall-clock time, rather than a benchmark where these evaluations are free. Perhaps the exclusive reliance on these benchmarks, though undoubtedly useful for quick experimentation, in the end holds back the paper and prevents the method's benefits from becoming apparent to the readers.\n\nAs a minor point (also raised by AR1), the paper is formatted incorrectly for ICLR: the font color is off, and more importantly the PDF is unsearchable (text cannot be selected, ctrl-F does not work), which makes it very difficult to quickly reference and review. Please try not to stray from the conference-provided style file for future submissions.\n\nI appreciate the cleverness of the method, the extent of the evaluation, and the thorough responses to the reviews. However, unfortunately with the current presentation, it is too difficult to discern the benefit of the proposed approach from the manuscript. The approach is nonetheless intuitively appealing and seems quite promising, and I hope the authors will take the reviewers' good feedback into account and resubmit the paper in the future.\n\n"

It's not clear what the overall goal of the work is, but it's interesting to see what the authors are trying to achieve. The main problem with this paper is that it doesn't seem to have a clear goal in mind. There are a number of problems with this work, but I'm not sure what's the overall aim of this work.",
        "This paper is a computational linguistic study of the semantics that can be inferred form text corpora given parsers (which are trained on human data) are used to infer the verbs and their objects in text. The reviewers agreed that the work was well executed, and that the experiments comparing the resulting representations to human data were solid. The method employed has little or no technical novelty (in my opinion, not necessarily a flaw), and it's not clear what tasks (beyond capturing human data) representations could be applied to (again, not a problem if the goal is to develop theories of cognition). \n\nThe first draft of the work missed important connections to the computational linguistics literature, where learning about 'affordances for verbs' (referred to as 'selectional preferences') has long been an important goal. The authors did a good job of setting out these connections in the revised manuscript, which the reviewers appreciated. \n\nThe work is well executed, and should be commended for relating ideas from different sub-fields in its motivation and framing. But my sincere view is that it does not meet the same standards of machine-learning or technical novelty met by other papers at this conference. It is unclear to me what the framing in terms of 'affordance' adds to a large body of literature studying the semantics of word embeddings, given various syntactically and semantically-informed innovations.  It feels to me like this work would have been an important contribution to the literature in 2013, but given the current state of the art in representation learning from text and jointly learning from text and other modalities, I would like to have seen some attempt to incorporate these techniques and bridge the gap between the notion of affordance in text/verbs (selectional preference) and Gibson's notion of object affordance (what you can do physically with an object) in experiments and modelling, not just in the discussion. Such a programme of research could yield fascinating insights into the nature of grounding, and the continuum from the concrete, which can be perceived and directly experienced, to the abstract, which must be learned from text. I encourage the authors to continue in this direction. An alternative is to consider submitting the current manuscript to venue where the primary focus is cognitive modelling, and accounting for human, behavioural data, and where there is less emphasis on the development of novel methods or models.\n\nFor these reasons, and considering the technical scope of related papers in the programme, I cannot fairly recommend acceptance in this case. \n\n"

This paper is primarily a theoretical contribution to the construction of assemblies of recurrent neural networks. We know that combinations of learned modular components can be powerful and far more tractable than learning bespoke models from scratch, particularly in applied domains (e.g. AlphaGo). Yet so far, we have no theoretical guarantees that these combinations will actually remain stable. The authors then show that they can best SOTA algorithms on some of the common (albeit easier) benchmarks in the field, even under (and perhaps because of) these constraints.",
        "In the context of recurrent neural networks, the motivation of the paper is to explore the \"space\" between fully trained models and almost not trained models, e.g. echo state networks, using a formal approach. In fact, a modular approach has proven to be very successful in many practical applications, and in addition brain seems to adopt this strategy as well. The addressed theoretical issue is stability of the network (i.e., the network implements a contraction map.) Specifically, it is assumed that a network is composed of a set of subnetworks that meet by construction some stability condition, and the problem is to design a mixing weight matrix, interconnecting the latent spaces of the subnetworks, able to give stability guarantees during and after training. Some novel stability conditions are proposed as well as two different approaches to design a successful mixing weight matrix. The original submitted paper was not easy to read, and after revision major problems with presentation have been resolved, although the current version looks more like an ordered collection of results/statements than a smooth and integrated flow of discourse. The revision has also addressed some concerns by reviewers on the role of size and sparsity of the modules, as well as the sensitivity of the stabilization condition on the mixing weight matrix has been experimentally assessed, obtaining interesting results. Overall the paper reports interesting results, however the novelty of the contribution seems to be a bit weak, e.g. stability conditions on recurrent networks (although different from the reported ones) were already presented in literature. Also the idea of exploiting, in one of the proposed models,  the fact that the matrix exponential of a skew-symmetric matrix is orthogonal to maintain the convergence condition during training, is not novel. Moreover, the experimental assessment does not provide a direct comparison, under the same architectural/learning setting, of the novel stability results versus the ones already presented in literature. Empirical results are obtained on simple tasks (using datasets with sequences of identical length), and relatively small networks, which limits a bit the scope of the assessment, as well as it is not clear if the observed improvements (where obtained) are statistically significant (especially when compared with results obtained by networks with the same order of parameters.) The quality of the assessment would increase significantly by considering datasets with sequences of different lengths, and involving more challenging tasks that do require larger networks.\n\n"

This paper provides previously-lacking in-depth empirical evidence to better understand the importance of combining different mechanisms for regularization, one of the most fundamental Concepts in Machine Learning.",
        "The paper in its most recent version claims that deep neural networks, when very carefully regularized, outperform methods such as Gradient Boosting Trees on tabular data. This is genuinely surprising to me (in a good way), and I suppose it is as well to the community.\n\nThe paper initially received negative reviews with two key remarks that \"The results are somewhat expected.\" (R4, R3, R2). Indeed, the original version mainly stated that very careful regularization helps on tabular data.  Naturally, the reviewers (including myself) seen then as the second key weakness that \"All experiments are run on tabular data.\" (R4, R3).\n\nBased on the reviews, the Authors have clarified and changed their message. I think it is well summarized by R2 \"The paper has been significantly refocused and now sells itself as a way of deep neural networks being competitive versus gradient boosting methods, which are dominating the tabular heterogeneous tasks.\"\n\nAs R2 said and was reflected in comments by other reviewers, \"[...] convinced by authors response on paper novelty, technical contribution and (after the re-focusing) potential usefulness to the community\".\n\nGiven the new message of the paper, a key new question surfaces. Is this indeed the first convincing demonstration that deep learning can outperform more standard methods on tabular data? R2 pointed out TabNet (see also Google Cloud offering) that already in 2019 claimed \"beating GB methods for the tabular data\". There is also NeurIPS work \"Regularization Learning Networks: Deep Learning\nfor Tabular Datasets\"; their abstract opens with \"Despite their impressive performance, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) typically underperform Gradient Boosting Trees (GBTs) on many tabular-dataset learning tasks. We propose that applying a different regularization coefficient to each weight might boost the performance of DNNs by allowing them to make more use\nof the more relevant inputs\". The latter work did not claim to beat GBT. Regardless, the two works should be carefully discussed and compared empirically to in the new version of the work. \n\nI am also not yet fully convinced by the added comparison to GDBT. Arguably, AutoML from the sklearn package is not the most popular way to use GDBT in practice. How would regularization cocktails compare to GDBT from XGBoost, optimized using either random search or bayesian optimization?\n\nBased on the above, I have to recommend the rejection of the paper. The key reason is: *the new reframing of the paper is exciting but warrants a much more detailed and careful evaluation*.\n\nI really appreciate the work the Authors have put in clarifying and changing the message of the paper. I understand this is disappointing that we won't be able to include the work in ICLR. Nevertheless, I hope that the Authors found the feedback useful, and wanted to thank the Authors for submitting the work for consideration in ICLR.\n\n"

The method performs well empirically.\n\nPro:\n* All reviewers agree that the proposed measure and algorithm is novel, sound, and original. \n* 3 out of 4 reviewers agree that the paper is well written. \n* The topic of risk sensitive RL is timely and important - 3 out of 4 reviewers rate the potential impact as good (3).\n* Empirical results justify the theoretical claims and the method performs well compared to other distributional RL methods\n\nCon:\n* In their initial assessment, reviewers point out minor technical flaws and some difficulties in understanding parts of the empirical evaluation. The authors have commented on the issues raised, but only 1 reviewer has responded to the authors' comments.\n* PeBL points out a potential shortcoming w.r.t. the training protocol (splitting the data).

Strengths: 1) The conceptual framework proposed in this paper is intuitive and helps reason about the safety a predictive model. 2) The case studies show how this framework can be useful not only in the assessment of regions within feature space that are problematic, but also in choosing hyperparameters such that the models are safe w.r.t this deviation metric. 3) The case of a more general piecewise lipschitz function and show how interpretable models can lead to more efficient computation of their metric, D(y, y_",

Their main concerns were regarding the limited discussion on choosing the reference model and the certification set.

I think the added discussion asked for by reviewers is well within what could be expected to be added for a camera-ready version (and indeed, this is already in the Appendix of the revision). \n\n"

        "This paper presents an intriguing empirical phenomenon in deep learning. They train a variety of architectures for different tasks using different datasets and study the relationship between the learned representations. In particular they collect the representations into a large matrix and take the top left singular vector and measure the cosine of the angle. They show that it is much smaller than one might expect, about 10 degrees or so, and has an approximate monotonicity property as the network is being trained although it does not seem to converge to zero. Moreover this measure also correlates with performance. \n\nThe reviewers had divided opinions on this paper. On the one hand, the range of experiments is impressive and truly demonstrates that this is a pervasive phenomenon. On the other hand, it is not so clear what it means. In particular, suppose we have a collection of graphs which have close to the same degree distributions. If we take the top left singular vectors of all the adjacency matrices, they would also have low angles between them. While this is a very different setting and there is no analogy between the experiments in this paper and this toy model, it does raise philosophical questions about whether the phenomenon is meaningful or is a byproduct of something else about the data. This may be a challenging question to answer, but one reviewer brought up a natural next step: One could measure the principal angle between the subspace of the top k left singular vectors across experiments for larger values of k. The authors do bring up the point that the spectrum decays very quickly, so it could be that beyond a certain point the singular vectors behave somewhat randomly. \n\n"

A novel take on the ability to find good sparse subnetwork do not perform as well as those for finding good \"weak\" (after training), even in for these toy problems.",
        "This paper takes on (in my view) one of the most important questions in the lottery ticket literature today: how small are the smallest lottery tickets that exist in our neural networks? Many methods have been proposed for finding weak lottery tickets (those that require training to reach full accuracy) and strong lottery tickets (those that do not), but we have no idea how close they come to finding the smallest lottery tickets. Moreover, in many cases, we only know how to find lottery ticket subnetworks early in training rather than at initialization. Is this a fundamental limitation on the existence of lottery tickets, or is this simply a limitation of our methods for finding them? I am personally very involved in lottery ticket conversations in the literature, and I believe I can speak with some authority when I say that these are vital questions where any progress is important.\n\nMoreover, these are exceedingly difficult research questions, and (again, in my view) the authors should be commended for taking them on. A naive approach to these questions would involve brute force search over all possible subnetworks, which is infeasible even on the smallest of toy examples, let alone the meaningful computer vision tasks where lottery ticket work typically focuses.\n\nI am sharing all of this information to provide background for my confident recommendation to accept this paper over the many legitimate concerns expressed by reviewers and those that I saw when reading the paper in detail. Those include that:\n* This paper does not solve any of these research problems in their entirety.\n* It focuses on toy networks smaller than those traditionally studied in the lottery ticket literature, and it is well known that lottery ticket behavior changes in character at larger scales.\n* Planting good subnetworks may be an unrealistic proxy for the kinds of subnetworks that actually emerge naturally.\n* There may be multiple good subnetworks in a network, not just the one that was planted.\n* The graphs are a bit hard to read.\n* I find the mix of pruning methods studied, which were designed with very different goals (pruning after training, pruning before training, finding strong lottery tickets), a bit confusing.\n\n**The bottom line:** With all of that said, in my view, the paper asks good questions and provides an initial foothold that other researchers will be able to build on as we seek more general answers. This is similar to the contributions made by Zhou et al., which started the conversation on strong lottery tickets, and potentially even Frankle & Carbin, which kicked off the lottery ticket discussion but got many things wrong. Both papers were good first attempts at solving big problems, and both were highly influential despite their flaws. Similarly, even if this submission isn't perfect in every way, this is among the most important kinds of contributions that a paper can make. For that reason, I strongly recommend acceptance under the belief that this paper will help to foster a valuable conversation in the literature.\n\nP.S. I really, truly, strongly beg the authors to redo their graphs following the style of some of the more user-friendly lottery ticket or pruning papers they have cited (e.g., Frankle et al., 2021). The graphs in this paper were really hard to parse. Really really really hard to parse. They're too small, the y-axis is often squished, gridlines would be helpful, the lines are overlapping in ways that are difficult to distinguish because the colors blend, etc. etc. This is quite possibly the biggest impediment I see to this paper's ability to have broader influence.\n\n"

To solve this task, the authors utilize a guiding network that generates a pseudo label (domain label) as well as a style code which are then provided to a generator network. The generator given a source image produces an output that follows the structure of the source yet preserves the style and \"domain\" details of the reference image.",

To achieve robust performance in this scenario, the authors use 1) clustering and 2) generator-discriminator structure to map images from different domains and generate images for target domains.  \n\nIn all, all the reviewers agree that this definition of unsupervised image translation is interesting. However, there are also several concerns for the real-world practical application and empirical results.  Unlike unsupervised text translation whose target language is known, the truly unsupervised image translation is difficult to make sense without identifying what is the target domain. This limits the contribution of this paper to some specific tasks instead of more general tasks. For the empirical results, the selection of data and the hyperparameter K do not convince the reviewers.\n\n\n\n"

But I do think for the paper to make an impact (and be ICLR ready) it needs more work both in the writing and maybe on the experimental side as well (consider some more complex task, or be more explicit on what is the common aspect between tasks in the distribution that can allow chameleon to work)\n\n"
