 A paper addresses a core issue of the popular conditional neural process: the predictions at each test point are conditionally independent given the conditioning set . The authors propose to go beyond a non-diagonal Gaussian to describe the joint distribution . The manuscript proposes variants of Neural process (NP), which can model correlation in the input (and in the output for multi-ouput regression) The main idea is to directly parameterize the mean and the covariance functions of a Gaussian predictive via neural networks .
Gold Metareview 1:
This paper proposes a class of neural processes that lifts the limitations of conditional neural processes (CNPs) and produces dependent/correlated outputs but that, as CNPs, is inherently scalable and it is easy to train via maximum likelihood. The proposed model is extended to multi-output regression and to capture non-Gaussian output distributions. Results are presented on synthetic data, an electroencephalogram dataset and on a climate modeling problem. The paper parameterizes the prediction map as a Gaussian, where the mean and covariance are determined using neural networks. Non-Gaussian prediction maps are obtained using copulas. 

Technically speaking, the reviewers found the approach to be incremental and only marginally significant and I agree with them. Issues such as estimates of computational cost, using fixed lengthscales for the covariances and relationships/using normalizing flows have been addressed by the authors satisfactorily. Empirically, the contribution of the paper is somewhat significant, as it provides similar flexibility to other more computationally expensive processes and more general assumptions than conditional neural processes.

 This paper studies switching between exploit and explore modes in reinforcement learning . It discusses switching mechanisms based on time ("blind switching") and based on state ("informed switching") Studying seven Atari games, an empirical analysis of different switching mechanisms is performed . Overall, the paper is very strong, well-motivated, and empirically sound . This paper investigates when to switch between exploitation and exploration and how long to stay in each exploration mode . It proposes new ways to explore the subject, especially with intra-episodic exploration variants .
Gold Metareview 2:
Exploration can happen at various levels of granularity and at different times during an episode,  and this work performs a study of the problem of exploration (when to explore/when to switch between exploring and exploitation, at what time-scale to do so, and what signals would be good triggers to switch). The study is performed on atari games.

Strenghts:
------------
The study is well motivated and the manuscript is overall well written
Studies a new problem area, and proposes an initial novel method for this problem
extensive study on atari problems

Weaknesses
--------------
some clarity issues as pointed out by the reviewers
no illustrative task is given to give a more intuitive exposition of the "when to explore" problem
comparison to some extra baselines like GoExplore would have been insightful

Rebuttal:
----------
Most clarity issues have been addressed satisfactorily. It has been explained why some requests for extra baselines would be challenging/or not relevant enough. While the authors agree that GoExplore would be an interesting baseline, they seem to have not added it. An illustrative task was not provided.

Summary:
------------
All reviewers agree that this manuscript opens up and tackles a novel direction in exploration, and provides an extensive empirical study on atari games (a standard benchmark for such problem settings). While I agree with the reviewers that point out that this paper could have been made stronger by adding an illustrative task and additional baselines like GoExplore, there is a general consensus that the provided empirical study on this novel problem setting is a good contribution in itself. Because of this I recommend accept.

Generated Summary 3:
 The novelty of this work is incremental, but it's still an interesting work for improving graph-level representations . The major concern is that the proposed method encourages the closeness of augmented views from the same graph instances but provide no guarantee that the transformation used (graph diffusion and sparsification with PPR + random remove edges) would be label-preserving . Important details such as optimal hyperparameter values are missing . The authors need to compare with more to substantiate this work .
Gold Metareview 3:
This paper proposes an unsupervised graph learning method [Iterative Graph Self-Distillation (IGSD)] by iteratively performing self-distillation to contrast graph pairs under different augmented views. This idea is then extended to semi-supervised setting where via a supervised contrastive loss and self-training. The method is empirically evaluated on some semi-supervised graph classification and molecular property prediction tasks, and has achieved promising results.

Reviewers agree that the method is interesting and the paper is well-written. The biggest concern from reviewers related to experimental evaluations of the method. The authors responded to this and included additional experiments. Although the reviewers appreciate the provided results and explanations, at the end they were not convinced about the empirical assessments. In particular, R1's post rebuttal comment indicates concerns about the reported performance of GCKN, which is different from the published one in Table 1 of GCKN paper. I encourage authors to improve on these experimental discrepancies and resubmit. 

Generated Summary 4:
 A paper studies how the vulnerability of a neural network model depends on its input dimension . Authors prove that for an *untrained* model, randomly . initialized with Xavier initialization, the gradient of the loss wrt the input is essentially independent of the architecture and task . This implies that the major factor affecting the norm of that gradient is the input . The authors provide a compelling theoretical explanation for a large class of adversarial examples . They unify several old perspectives, and convincingly argue for genuinely new scaling relationships .
Gold Metareview 4:
This paper suggests that adversarial vulnerability scales with the dimension of the input of neural networks, and support this hypothesis theoretically and experimentally. 

The work is well-written, and all of the reviewers appreciated the easy-to-read and clear nature of the theoretical results, including the assumptions and limitations. (The AC did not consider the criticisms raised by Reviewer 3 justified. The norm-bound perturbations considered here are a sufficiently interesting unsolved problem in the community and a clear prerequisite to solving the broader network robustness problem.) 

However, many of the reviewers also agreed that the theoretical assumptions - and, in particular, the random initialization of the weights - greatly oversimplify the problem. Reviewers point out that the lack of data dependence and only considering the norm of the gradient considerably limit the significance of the corresponding theoretical results, and also does not properly address the issue of gradient masking.

 This paper studies the problem of learning to play a Nash equilibrium in two-player, zero-sum Markov games . The main algorithm is a version of the classic fictitious play algorithm . It operates on the Q-values, but a key novelty is the use of a particular form of regularization in the best response process . The authors propose a novel entropy regularized policy optimization method for both agents . They proved the sequence of joint policies converges to a neighborhood of a Nash . equilibrium at a sublinear rate .
Gold Metareview 5:
The paper shows that a form of Fictitious Self-Play converges to the Nash equilibria in Markov games. Understanding the theoretical properties of Fictitious Self-Play is important, however the paper in its current form is not ready for publication. The paper needs a more thorough discussion on related works, the assumptions made, and as pointed out by Reviewer3, the convergence argument needs to be expanded and explained in more detail. Further, I encourage authors to add experiments and compare their algorithm with other methods.

 The authors proposed a method for source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) task . The key idea is to combine the advantages of global alignment and feature consistency . DaC uses the source model to split the target data into source-like and target-specific samples . The two are further aligned using maximum mean discrepancy loss . The authors demonstrate extensive experiments on three datasets and verify the performance of the proposed method . They present both theoretical results and numerical results that illustrate the superiority of DaC .
Gold Metareview 6:
This paper proposes a relatively complicated method for source-free unsupervised domain adaptation, which integrates several techniques into a divide and contrast framework. The idea of dividing the target data into source-like subset and target-specific subset and employing global alignment and feature consistency for each subset is novel when the source data is inaccessible. The contrastive learning and memory-based MMD are novel in the context of source-free domain adaptation and introduce theoretical benefits in terms of the expansion theory and domain alignment theory, respectively. Reviewers were on the positive side while holding some concerns on the marginal improvement over the SoTA methods, which were addressed in the author rebuttal. AC generally agreed that the paper has introduced a novel and solid contribution to the field, with a nice connection between algorithmic methods and theoretical insights, and  recommended the paper for acceptance. Authors are suggested to incorporate all rebuttal material in the revision and if possible, to work out a recipe for easing the adoption of their relatively complicated framework that comes with many modules and loss terms.

 This paper describes an SMC algorithm to sample the posterior distribution of latent states $p_\theta(z_{1:T)$ in a latent variable models . Empirical experiments suggest that the method outperforms previous work . Choosing larger N=16 also has a better performance in the FIVO paper . The paper considers SMC to construct variational approximations . SMC methods can be improved with partial rejection control (PRC)
Gold Metareview 7:
This paper explores the use of partial rejection control (PRC) for improved SMC-based variational bounds. While an unbiased SMC variant with PRC has been previously introduced by Kudlicka et al. (2020), this work introduces innovations that can help apply such ideas to variational inference. These bounds result in improvements in empirical performance. 

This paper was heavily discussed, with significant engagement by both the authors and the reviewers. Most reviewers recommended acceptance of this paper, with one reviewer (R4) recommending against acceptance. R4's central concerns regard the novelty of the proposed approach and its positioning relative to the existing SMC literature. The authors argued vigorously in the comments that this paper should be judged as a contribution to the VI literature and not the SMC literature.  Unfortunately, I will recommend that this paper is rejected. It is my opinion that R4's concerns were not fully addressed.

On the one hand, I agree with the authors that there is significant value to be had in exploring variants of SMC for VI. Indeed, some prior art, like FIVO and IWAE, contributed little to the Monte Carlo literature. I believe that these were good contributions.

On the other hand, I am concerned that the current draft does not clearly circumscribe its contributions. I read the sections that disuss the works of Schmon et al. (2019) and Kudlicka et al. (2020), and the writing did not leave me with a clear enough sense of the differences. I also read the abstract and introduction of the paper. The introduction of the paper positions this work clearly within the VI literature, but does not clearly discuss prior SMC art, e.g., it does not cite Kudlicka et al. (2020). Despite citing rejection control for SMC, the writing of the abstract and introduction left me with the impression that this work was the first to introduce *unbiased, partial* rejection control for SMC. I believe that impressions matter and that the machine learning community should be generous to adjacent communities when assigning credit.

I realize that my decision is a matter of taste. I also want to say that I am confident that the authors have a clear sense of where their contribution sits, and I suspect that it is a valuable contribution. However, I cannot recommend the draft in its current form. If this is a contribution to the VI literature, as the authors argue, then the authors should not hesitate to give full credit to prior SMC art. My reading of the current draft still leaves me confused about which aspects of the SMC estimator are actual contributions.

This paper addresses a meta-learning method which involves bilevel optimization. It is claimed that two limitations (myopia of MG and restricted consideration of geometry of search space) that most of existing methods have can be resolved by the MBG with a properly chosen pseudo-metric. The algorithm first bootstraps a target from the meta- learner, then optimizes the meta-learner by minimizing the distance to that target under a chosen pseudo-metric. The authors also establish conditions that guarantee performance improvements and show that metric can be sued to control meta-optimization. All the reviewers agree that the idea is interesting and experiments well support it. Authors did a good job in the rebuttal phase, resolving most of concerns raised by reviewers, leading that two of reviewers raised their score. While the current theoretical results are limited to a simple case where L=1$, the method is attractive for meta-learning community. All reviewers agree to champion this paper. Congratulations on a nice work.

 The paper discusses the problem of shift between train and test data distributions . The authors assume that training data originate from multiple 'environments', each with particular distribution . They propose a new framework (EDNIL) through which they can infer the environments from data and then train an environment invariant model . The method is more scalable and less sensitive to initializations than the prior methods . Paper tackles an important challenge of robust learning with no environment labels .
Gold Metareview 10:
This work presents a novel environment-free invariant learning method that uses an auxiliary network to learn environment-specific features, from which environment inferences can be derived. The method is composed of two jointly learned models, that take care of the environment identification, the learning of the invariant representations, and the label predictions, produced by a multi-headed neural network. The proposed model is compared to different alternative models from the literature of the field, in different challenging benchmarks, and the results show that it closely achieves the best possible invariant learning performance.

After some initial discussions, all reviewers agreed that this work is ready for publication, as the work addresses an important problem, presents good empirical results, and will be of significant interest to the community.

I thank the authors for their submission and active participation in the discussions. This papers is borderline. On the positive side, reviewers emphasized this is a well written [ovqB,1zPe] and sound paper [BUDa] with good theoretical [td5N,ovqB,1zPe] and empirical [BUDa,td5N,ovqB] results. On the negative side, reviewers remarked clarity [KyZj,AVki], incremental with respect to Tasse et al (2020) [KyZj], relatively restricted Boolean task algebra [td5N], toyish nature of the environments considered [ovqB], and some missing details [1zPe]. During discussion, the sentiment seems to be somewhat lukewarm with none of the reviewers strongly favoring acceptance or rejection. It seems the main remaining concern is around the toyish nature of the environments used in this paper. I acknowledge that and I believe the authors could include experiments on more complex environments. However, I also give the authors credit for addressing most of the reviewer's concerns during rebuttal and for presenting a solid empirical and theoretical result that the research community can build upon in the future. I am therefore recommending acceptance of this paper and highly encourage the authors to further improve their paper based on the reviewer feedback.

 The paper is motivated by using reinforcement learning (RL) methods in inventory control . It customizes Q-learning for a special one-sided feedback/full-feedback setting . The writing needs significant improvement . The paper proposes two algorithms for the classic inventory control problem . It establishes cardinality-independent regret bonds for the two algorithms in terms of length of episode and horizon . Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms .
Gold Metareview 13:
This paper explores the performance of Q-learning in the presence of either one-sided feedback or full feedback. Such feedbacks play an important role in improving the resulting regret bounds, which are (almost) not affected by the dimension of the state and action space. The motivation of such feedback settings stems from problems like inventory control. However, the assumptions underlying the theory herein are often quite strong, which might limit the applicability of the theory. The dependency on the length per episode H can also be improved.

The reviewers highly appreciated the replies and the additional experiments. We also had a private discussion on the paper. To summarize: the replies alleviated quite a few concerns, however the consensus was that the paper still does not meet the bar for a highly competitive conference like ICLR.

The idea of combining MPC (on a 'wrong' model)  with a learned cost function is very interesting and a promising direction. On the downside the reviewers are still not entirely convinced about the contribution and believe that the paper requires a significant re-write to incorporate the discussed points as well as an additional round of reviews.

 The proposed method works as follows . Given samples are partitioned into two parts; one is for classifier training and the other is for data synthesizer training . After training, the DP synthesizer generates samples and the DP classifier labels them . By the post-processing theorems, the resulting are differentially private which are published as synthesized samples . The authors proposed QUAIL, an algorithm that uses a supervised model and a synthetic data model to generate synthetic data that is good for downstream tasks .
Gold Metareview 17:
The paper surveys existing differentially private data synthesis
methods, and introduces an algorithm that learns both a generator and
a classifier in a differentially private mode.

The problem is highly timely and important. Results are promising.

Main remaining concerns after discussion between the reviewers and the
authors are:

- reason why the proposed scheme can give better classification
accuracy, should be clarified more

- unclarity on conclusions that can be drawn from the experiments. The
revised version has improved on this somewhat.

One explanation for the problems was suggested to be that the paper
tries, at the same time, to both present a new method and be a
survey. Is hard to do in a short paper, and as a result, the paper
lacks focus. At the very least, more work is needed.

The authors are encouraged to continue their work on this
important problem, and the review comments hopefully help in that.

 This paper presents an unsupervised learning model for disentangled latent representation learning . The model works on a combined latent space including both entangled variable and separable variable . The most impressive part is the one-at-a-time (OAT) factor learning approach . The training procedure involves multiple steps and to me it is not straightforward how to select the model . The paper has several issues, including inaccurate claims, insufficient experiments, and many typos .
Gold Metareview 21:
This paper presents a method for unsupervised learning of disentangled representations by first training a VAE with a tangled set of latents, and then sequentially learning disentangled latent variables one at a time from the entangled initial VAE latent space. On several toy disentanglement benchmarks, the method is shown to perform competitively with previous VAE and GAN approaches. 

There were several concerns from reviewers around the clarity and description of the proposed one-factor-at a time (OAT) training procedure. While the updated draft addressed several typos and some clarity issues, multiple reviewers continued to find the method description problematic. There were additional concerns around the viability of the method on real-world datasets where the number of factors are not known, and as the authors stated the proposed method can also result in one factor of variation encoded into mulitple latent variables, which hurts on many of the disentanglement metrics.  The addition of CelebA downstream task evaluation begins to address this concern of real-world data, but more rigorous experiments (including more description of how models were selected) and discussion of the limtiations of the proposed method are needed. There is also no theoretical motivation as to why the proposed intervention-based factor learning algorithm should recover the ground truth factors.

Given the concerns over experimental results, clarity, and lack of theoretical motivation, I suggest rejecting this paper in the current form.

 This paper considers the combinatorial semi-bandits problem under two settings: (1) probabilistically triggered arms setting where the set of played arms can trigger reward on other arms, (2) the non-triggering setting with independent arms . For both these settings the authors improve batch-size dependence in regret as compared to previous work by considering a new variance-based condition on the underlying reward distributions . This work is theoretical in nature and does not have a societal impact .
Gold Metareview 23:
Thank the authors for their submission.

The paper studies combinatorial multi-armed bandit with probabilistically triggered arms. That is an MAB setting in which, at each round, the learner chooses a subset of the arms and obtains a reward that is some function of expected rewards of the chosen arms. In addition, the learner only observes feedback on a random subset of her chosen arms (triggered arms). 

The paper relaxes a smoothness assumption laid by a previous work, and further improves the dependence on K in the regret bound, where K is the batch size (maximum number of triggered arms)
The authors provide computationally-efficient algorithms that are based on Bernstein concentration inequality, facilitating the improved bounds. 
The paper is well-written and organized, and the theoretical results are sound.

 The paper presents an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning method for novelty detection . The goal of their training scheme is to create an ensemble of models that has a high disagreement on the out-of-distribution samples in the unlabeled set . The success of the method largely relies on the models in the ensemble having sufficiently different outputs on OOD samples . The paper is generally well-written, however, there is some confusion listed as follows: Some confusion exists both empirically and theoretically .
Gold Metareview 24:
The authors propose a semi-supervised novelty detection method which tries to identify out-of-distribution samples in the unlabeled data (consisting of in- and out-distribution samples) using a disagreement score of an ensemble. The ensemble is generated by fine-tuning the trained classiifer on the labeled training data plus the unlabeled data which all get a fixed label (which is repeated several times to generate the ensemble). The main idea is that one uses early stopping based on an in-distribution validation set in order to avoid overfitting on the unlabeled points which allows then identification of the out-distribution points via the disagreement score.

The reviewers appreciated the simplicity of the approach and the extensive experimental results. The authors did a good job in trying to answer all questions and concerns of the reviewers. 

However, some concerns remained:
- the setting assumes that the OOD data is fixed which was considered as partially unrealistic and thus evaluation of the OOD detection performance on unseen OOD distributions was requested in order to understand the limitations of the method (this was only partially done by the authors). 
- the theoretical result is for a two-layer network and completely based on previous work. As the authors use much deeper networks later on in the experiments, this result cannot be used to theoretically justify the approach. 
- there remained concerns about the necessary diversity of the ensemble and the early stopping procedure

While I think that the paper has its merits, it is not yet ready for publication. I encourage the authors to to take into account the above points and other remaining concerns of the reviewers in a revised version.

 A paper studies hyperparameter sensitivity for the outlier detection (OD) task, which is a fundamental challenge in the unsupervised setting . The paper proposes an "ensemble" of autoencoders of varying depths and widths called RobOD . The proposed RobOD seems to be simple and easy-to-implement . The authors soundly identify the problem of hyperparameters selection in deep OD by . They propose to leverage skip connection and batch ensemble technique to speed up the hyper-ensemble calculation .
Gold Metareview 26:
This paper empirically demonstrates the sensitivity of unsupervised OD methods to hyperparameters and proposes ensembles of models with differing hyperparameters along with training techniques based on weight sharing to do so efficiently. 

The authors provided additional experiments to answer some reviewer's major concerns regarding the (meta-)HP robustness of the ensemble methods. While there are natural fluctuations with respect to the (meta) hyperparameters, a larger number of hyperparameters included usually resulted in a close to optimal AUROC.

Another concern for two reviewers was the extendability of the efficient ensemble training techniques to other models such as GANs etc. As the authors replied, even though skip connections might not be adaptable to other techniques, e.g. for ensembling various widths, zero-masked layers with BatchEnsemble would also be broadly applicable to ensemble-learn other unsupervised representation learning models. Perhaps in the final version, the authors further discuss with a short experiment how the AE-specific scaling techniques add to the performance.

A further concern was the lack of theoretical underpinning about the (meta)HP-robustness. Given that the reviewers agree that this paper provides ample empirical evidence and praise the experimental value, we think theoretical work (providing HP sensitivity results is highly nontrivial in general, let alone for neural networks) can be part of future work but the lack of it in the current manuscript should not prevent the publication of this work.

Gold Metareview 27:
This paper studies the last iterate rate of convergence of the well-known extragradient and optimistic gradient algorithms in smooth monotone games with continuous convex action sets. The main result of the paper is to show that both algorithms (with constant step size) enjoy tight last-iterate convergence rates for setting (previous papers either 1) only applied to unconstrained domains 2) were asymptotic, or 3) required dependence on arbitrarily large problem-dependent constants).

This paper resolves a well-known open problem within the min-max optimization community, and is likely to have significant impact. The reviewers agree that the paper is well-written, and the the techniques (using the "tangent residual" as a potential function) are novel. For the final version, the authors are encouraged to incorporate the reviewers' suggestions to improve the presentation.

Reviewers in particular liked that the paper is presenting an interesting and systematic study of reward hacking [GVMn] that is useful to the research community [bfGN] and targets an important problem [uYeb] in a rigorous way [16uL]. I thus recommend accepting the paper, but I strongly encourage the authors to further improve their paper based on the reviewer feedback, in particular in regards to improving positioning with respect to related work and a better formalization of their work.

Generated Summary 29:
 The paper proposes a method for accelerating distributed high-dimensional regression under sparsity constraints . The application of Nesterov's method to this setting is clear and intuitive . The explanation of the method is a bit dense and may not make complete sense to readers unfamiliar with all the technical prerequisites . An accelerated algorithm is proposed, and its convergence and statistical properties are proven . Strengths: The manuscript clearly states the proposed problem and compares it with existing literature . The organization and presentation of this paper can be further improved .
Gold Metareview 29:
The paper provides novel guarantees for the well-studied distributed sparse regression problem. Their theoretical results improve upon the state of the art and extend to settings that many previous results could not handle. From a technical perspective, their result builds upon previous frameworks, but also requires a number new, novel ideas. The paper does have some downsides; as mentioned previously, some of their ideas do build quite strongly off of previous work, and the presentation of the paper is quite dense, as several reviewers noted. However, the consensus of the reviewers overall is that the technical contribution of the paper is above the bar for acceptance, and would be of interest to the distributed optimization community.

 The idea of using randomized smoothing to construct a robust conformity score is novel and theoretically sound . Overall, I think the paper is well-written and reach the acceptance bar of ICLR . Post-hoc "wrapper-style'' procedures for uncertainty quantification are of great value due to a high number of engineering tweaks used during the model development stage . The effectiveness of the proposed methods was demonstrated on the CIFAR10, CifAR100, and ImageNet datasets .

This paper studies the problem of producing distribution-free prediction sets using conformal prediction that are robust to test-time adversarial perturbations of the input data. The authors point out that these perturbations could be label and covariate dependent, and hence different from covariate-shift handled in Tibshirani et al 19, the label-shift handled in Podkopaev and Ramdas 21, and the f-divergence shifts of Cauchois et al 2021. 

The authors propose a relatively simple idea that has appeared in other literatures like optimization but appears to be new to the conformal literature: (i) use a smoothed (using Gaussian noise on X, and inverse Gaussian CDF) nonconformity score function, in order to control its Lipschitz constant, (ii) utilize a larger score cutoff than the standard 1-alpha quantile of calibration scores employed in conformal prediction. The observation that point (i) alone lends some robustness to adversarial perturbations of the data is interesting. As several experiments in the paper and responses to reviewers show, this comes at the (apparently necessary) price of larger prediction sets. 

I read through all the comments and also the supplement. The authors have responded very well to all the reviewers questions/concerns, adding significant sections to their supplement as a result. Three reviewers are convinced, but one remaining reviewer requested additional experiments to compare with Cauchois et al (in addition to all the others already produced by the authors originally and in response to reviewers). However, the authors point out that the code in the aforementioned paper was not public, but they were able to privately get the code from the authors during the rebuttal period. At this point, I recommend acceptance of the paper even without those additional experiments, since it is not the authors' fault that the original code was not public. Nevertheless, I suggest to the authors that, if possible, they could add some comparisons to the camera-ready since they now have the code.

I congratulate the authors on a nice work, a very solid rebuttal, and also the astute reviewers on pointing out various aspects that could be improved. 

Minor point for the authors (for the camera-ready): I would like to comment on the Rebuttal point 4.4 in the supplement, which then got further discussed in the thread. The reviewer points out four references [R1-R4]. I will add one more to the list [R5] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10634.pdf (Kivaranovic et al, appeared in 2019, published in 2020). I think the literature reviews in this area are starting to be messy, and all authors need to do a better job. Clearly, the original paper of Vovk et al already establishes various types of conditional validity (and calls it PAC-style guarantee), produces guarantees that others in this area produce, and it appears that much recreation of the wheel is occurring. For eg, [R2, R4] do not cite [R5], despite [R5] appearing earlier and being published earlier, and having PAC-style guarantees and experiments with neural nets, etc. However, in turn, [R5] do not cite Vovk [R1], but [R2, R4] do cite [R1]. (And [R3] does not seem to be relevant to this discussion of conditional validity?) In any case, I am not sure any of these papers need citing since the current paper does not deal with conditional validity. If at all, just one sentence like "Conditional validity guarantees, of the styles suggested by Vovk [2012], would be an interesting avenue for future work".

 A paper describes a NeRF-like representation for binaural room impulse responses in a given acoustic space . It is an implicit representation of listener position, orientation, and ear, as well as source position, time, and frequency . Experiments on Soundspaces and MeshRIR datasets show it is able to reproduce realistic effects in loudness maps like sonic shadows from doorways for irregularly-shaped rooms . The main limitation of the paper is the evaluation .

The authors present Neural Acoustic Fields (NAF), which render sounds for arbitrary emitter and listener positions in a scene. Overall, the reviewers are very positive (8-8-8-5). The authors addressed many of the reviewers' questions about previous related work and rendering spatial binaural audio.

 This paper reinterprets the theory of PPO-clip based on the hinge policy optimization . The sign of the advantage function becomes the label, and the difference in action probabilities between policy after and before an update becomes the classifier's output . This paper suggests a generalization to the commonly used PPO(-clip) algorithm . The main contributions of this paper are: They introduce a family of algorithm that includes PPO-clip . Show convergence results for these algorithms (under less strict assumptions than previous works)
Gold Metareview 32:
All reviewers agreed that analysis of PPO is interesting. 
During the discussion, however, there was an agreement that the current work is too thin in novelty and contribution: it provides only convergence analysis under very strong assumptions, and heavily builds on techniques from prior works. Meanwhile, for conventional policy gradient, recent works provided convergence rates.
As one reviewer pointed out - this work does not further our theoretical understanding on why PPO is better than vanilla policy gradient, as all the established results hold for policy gradient, even with less assumptions.
I encourage the authors to strengthen their paper by relaxing Assumption 4 (perhaps based on the robust classification idea raised in the discussion), and by further providing rate results.

 The paper addresses the problem of sample-efficient inference for symbolic physical rules . Authors propose a generative model along with a symbolic regression framework, in which forces are produced from a probabilistic context free grammar . This particular grammar is parameterized by a few latent variables related to unobserved properties of the physical environment, such as mass and charge . The force law grammar, to my knowledge, is something novel in this area . The error bars in figure 5 is somewhat not very indicative of the stability of the method .
Gold Metareview 33:
This paper proposes a method for learning physics combining symbolic computation and learning in an interesting way, targeting sample efficiency. At the initial evaluation, it was on the fence but leaning towards acceptance, with 3 slightly positive and one slightly negative review. 

The strengths lie in the combination between symbolic reasoning and statistical ML with a formulation around the classical EM framework. On the other hand, an important issue of the paper is its quite simplistic evaluation on now very easy problems and benchmarks. While benchmarks tend to be simple in the field of learning physics, current work does address more difficult problems than the problems tackled in this paper.

Another issue discussed was the simple trade-off in injecting hand-crafted inductive bias into a system leading to increased sample efficiency, which was perceived as unsurprising by some reviewers. While this is common in ML, and even strongly more so in learning physics from data synthetically generated with known physical laws, it was perceived to be particularly unsurprising in this paper where the benchmarks are indeed very simple and the laws directly encoded.

The AC discussed this paper with the PCs, and it was judged that the weaknesses in evaluation, in particular the simplicity of the tasks, cannot compensate for the interesting hybrid symbolic/ML formulation, and decided to reject the paper.

 This paper evaluates a gradient-based subset selection method in hyperparameter optimization . The effectiveness of the method is experimentally verified on datasets of text, computer vision, and tabular domain . The evaluation could be improved by providing more experiments on the order of the hyperparameters . The paper’s empirical work is very well done. It contains clear experiments setting, abundant real world examples, thoughtful baselines, detailed ablation studies and interesting analysis .
Gold Metareview 34:
This paper proposes AUTOMATA, an approach that uses GradMatch to select subsets of data in order to accelerate hyperparameter tuning. The reviewers all found the approach to be practical and empirically effective. There were concerns about the robustness to different subset sizes, particularly across different datasets, but the authors demonstrated that AUTOMATA works well across a number of settings during the rebuttal period. The remaining criticism largely revolves around the novelty of the approach, but the majority of the reviewers believe that this is a useful application of gradient-based subset selection.


Generated Summary 35:
 The paper presents a method for improving tail-label performance in extreme multi-label learning setup . It is based on the finding that the distribution of the norms of the learnt weight vectors also follows a power-law . The approach overall seems more like an ad-hoc post-processing step than a learning algorithm . The proposed methods are novel, perhaps less so to someone who is an expert in XML . Both the proposed methods outperform a host of highly competitive baselines .
Gold Metareview 35:
The paper presents some interesting insights, but all reviewers have agreed that it does not meet the bar of ICLR. The theoretical results require revision as several issues have been indicated in the reviews. The authors have tried to correct them during the rebuttal, but the reviewers remain unconvinced.  Also the novelty is limited as re-ranking is a well-known concept and decoupling of head and tail labels is an approach often used in practice across many applications.

The authors should also clarify the way the RankNet method is used and implemented to clarify the issue raised by Reviewer 1. Finally, let me notice that adjusting thresholds for labels has been considered in the XMLC literature, in the context of optimization of the macro F-measure (Extreme F-measure Maximization using Sparse Probability Estimates, ICML 2016).



Generated Summary 36:
 This paper examines an interesting problem, so-called churn prediction provides some nice proofs, builds distillation-based algorithms and demonstrated the performance to multi-class problems in experiments . The primary limitation of this study is that, while the underlying problem framework is intriguing, it does not appear to make a significant impact . In real-life applications of predictive models, predictions often form a step of the process . Changes in the predictive model often need to be validated end to end using methods such as A/B tests .
Gold Metareview 36:
The paper introduces a procedure to control the churn (i.e. differences in the predictive model due o retraining) using distillation.

This is a strong paper, with novel technique which is clearly presented, and is backed by sound theory. The experimental results were also deemed extremely convincing by reviewers TJ4g and pZBb. 

Reviewer nqfu raised a question about the similarities between churn reduction and domain adaptation. The authors have addressed this by pointing out similarities to their work but also noting that, in the settings mentioned by the reviewer, alternative approaches such as completely retraining the model might be more appropriate. This part of the rebuttal is convincing.

Reviewer TJ4g has pointed out several points of improvement, to which the authors have responded adequately.

All in all, this paper is ready for and deserving of acceptance.

 This paper proposes a framework based on principle components analysis (PCA) to speed up the missing data imputation process . The experiments indicate that the imputation presents low MSE and, when applied to classification tasks, results in similar or better accuracy values . The main motivation is relevant and promising . There are two use cases, fashion MNIST (imaging data) and Parkinson (voice recording) datasets, that allow for more efficient handling of missing data .
Gold Metareview 38:
This paper proposes a framework based on principle components analysis (PCA) to speed up the missing data imputation. It divides the feature sets into two partitions -- the fully observed one and the one that contains missing values. The proposed method applies PCA to the fully observed partition to do dimensionality reduction, followed by the existing imputation methods. The authors further propose to apply PCA to the imputed data to speed up the downstream classification task.

The major weakness is that the methodological contribution is quite limited. Projecting data into lower dimensional spaces to speed up downstream tasks is not new. In particular, the main assumption of random missingness has been considered before 10-20 years ago and the more challenging setting of non-random missingness was not considered. Overall the reviewers mostly agree that the contribution is limited.

 The CorInfoMax is a second order statistics based mutual information method to avoid collapse problem in self supervised learning (SSL) It used log-determinant mutual information (LDMI) as the measure between data pairs with different augmentations . Mathematically, the paper gave step-by-step formulation to derivate the final form of the objective via its first-order Taylor series approximation . Experiments on three small size datasets and one medium size dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed method .
Gold Metareview 39:
The paper describes a self-supervised learning method based on an information maximization criterion that naturally prevents dimensional collapse. The authors consider the Shannon mutual information under the assumption that the data is Gaussian. A first-order approximation to the log-determinant of the sum of two matrices is used to simplify the final objective. Experiments on 4 image datasets show that the proposed approach gives better results than contrastive and non-contrastive methods.

Strengths:

1 - The paper is well written and easy to follow.
2 - The paper is theoretically grounded on correlative information measure of representation.
3 - Strong results on some downstream classification problems.
4 - Initially the experiments included only one downstream task regarding classification, but the paper has been updated to include also results for object segmentation and detection task.
5 - Novel and well motivated.
6 - state-of-the-art SSL performance.

Weaknesses:

- Some weaknesses are pointed out by reviewer GZwK, but these are not well justified.

Decision:

A majority of reviewers vote for acceptance. The only reviewer voting slightly towards rejection is GZwK, with a reasoning that is not well justified. For example, the main criticisms mentioned by reviewer GZwK

- The paper directly generalizes the earlier proposed log-determinant mutual information to the field of self-supervised learning. 
- this paper does not give a deep-going analysis that why the second-order statistics can play a important role in self-supervised learning

are not mentioned by any of the other reviewers.

Because of this, I have decided to accept the paper.

This paper proposes environment fields, a representation that models reaching distances within a scene. Dense environment fields are learnt using a neural network, and the effectiveness of this representation is shown on 2D maze environments and 3D indoor environments. This paper received hugely contrasting reviews, with two reviewers being very supportive and one reviewer providing the lowest score of 1. In light of this, I'll start with providing my takeaways on the review and discussion with reviewer z3Y4 (rating of 1) and then proceed to the remaining discussion.

Reviewer z3Y4 has provided the score of 1 and has made strong remarks that include: "what is proposed in this paper is simply not comprehensible", "description of the method itself is simply devoid of all required detail", "The main claims of the paper are incorrect or not at all supported by theory or empirical results." and " what is being proposed in this paper is simply too unclear and vague to be assessed". **Such dismissive remarks, in my opinion, are completely unnecessary and create a toxic discussion and review environment.**

Reviewer z3Y4 has many criticisms of the submission, but the primary ones include: (a) the lack of details throughout the paper (b) the positioning of the paper in the abstract and introduction, and (c) the lack of experiments in continuous environments. Re (a): It is well understood in our research community that providing every last detail in the main submission is nearly impossible due to the restriction on the number of pages. Providing excess details in the main paper also often reduces the readability of the paper. Such details are better addressed in the appendix and crucially, the code. The authors have provided some details in the appendix and have indicated that they will release a code base.  I also agree with the authors that justifying every last detail in the network architecture such as choice of an activation function is not necessary for this submission. The same goes with describing methods in past works in detail vs referring the reader to the appropriate citation. As a result, I believe that the authors have addressed (a) well. Re (b): This has also been addressed by the authors, by pointing out relevant parts of the paper that had the necessary details. Re (c): In this regard, the paper clearly contains a well laid out experiment in 3D indoor scenes, so as far as I am concerned, this has been addressed in the main submission.

Reviewers AhgQ and fAEP have supported this submission but also laid out some concerns that include:
(1) Are the gradients suboptimal ?
(2) Positioning the paper with regards to past works
(3) Motivation behind using the VAE
(4) Qualitative analysis and failures
The authors have addressed these 4 concerns well using the rebuttal as well as via a revision of the appendix. The reviewers, post discussion have indicated their satisfaction with the revised submission.

I think this paper is interesting and proposes a novel scene representation which can be useful for others in the Embodied AI community. I am in agreement with reviewers AhgQ and fAEP, and in spite of the strong reject score by z3Y4, I recommend accepting this paper.

 A number of steps in the method are not well motivated in the text, and left to the reader to understand their purpose . The authors include a gap of 0.1 in the "Gray_hair" category as "comparable" in the Black hair category . I think additional work on section 2.5 through section 3 would be helpful to improve clarity . The paper builds upon the work of Boa et al (2017 ) (Conditional VAE GAN)
Gold Metareview 41:
The paper proposes a supervised adversarial method for disentangling the latent space of a VAE into two groups: latents z which are independent of the given attribute y, and \hat{y} which contains information about y. Since the encoder also predicts \hat{y} it can be used for classification and the paper shows competitive results on this task, apart from the attribute manipulation task. Reviewers had raised points about model complexity and connections to prior works which the authors have addressed and the paper is on the borderline based on the scores. 

Though none of the reviewers explicitly pointed out the similarity of the paper with Fader networks (Lample et al., 2017), the adversarial setup for getting attribute invariant 'z' is exactly same as in Fader networks, as also pointed out in an anonymous comment. The only difference is that encoder in the current paper also predicts the attribute itself (\hat{y}), which is not the case in Fader n/w, and hence the encoder can be used as a classifier as well (authors have also mentioned and discussed this difference in their response). However, the core idea of the paper as outlined in the title of the paper, ie, using adversarial loss for information factorization, is very similar to this earlier work, which diminishes the originality of the work. 

With the borderline review scores, the paper can go in either of the half-spaces (accept/reject) but I am hesitant to recommend an "accept" due to limited originality of the approach. However, if there is space in the program, the paper can be accepted.

The authors present a GAN for learning a continuous representation of disease-related image patterns from regional volume information generated from structural MRI images.
The reviewers find the problem relevant and appreciate the proposed solution. They find the paper well-written and find the empirical results on Alzheimer brain MRIs relevant for the neuroscience community.
 
The overall objective function includes several hyper-parameters. As pointed out as the main weak point by multiple reviewers this may hint at overengineering/overfitting to a data set. However, the reviewers also mention that the regularizers are all sufficiently well-motivated in the paper and the author response.

Reviewers highlight comparisons on the real data as a strong result demonstrating that Surreal GAN was able to isolate two major sources/locations of atrophy in Alzheimer’s disease. Overall, the reviews are positive in majority.

 There are few pretraining corpora / datasets and legal-domain specific language models for Korean law . This paper introduces a large-scale Korean language legal corpus, different downstream NLP tasks relevant to the legal domain . The data and language model are accessible through HuggingFace . The authors present a new benchmark for three different types of legal tasks (classification, judgement prediction, and summarization) in Korean . Existing legal tasks are largely English-oriented .
Gold Metareview 44:
This paper presents a large corpus of Korean legal documents, paired with labels corresponding to two classification tasks, two legal judgment prediction tasks, and one summarization task. Reviewers praised the uniqueness of the new resource.

However, there is some criticism of the results section, with several reviewers bringing up possible comparisons to other models and wondering whether the performance of this model has been analyzed thoroughly.  The authors argue in particular that mT5 and KoGPT-2 can benefit from continued pre-training this corpus, which seems satisfactory, although there is the question raised by 7fpy that this is essentially pre-training on the test tasks and may be too generous when assessing the performance on other legal-domain tasks that arise down the road.  Reviewer 7fpy brings up some valid critiques of the dataset construction: several points about filtering were unclear, as was the strength of the automatic pipeline used to construct the dataset.

There are a few ethical concerns raised by the ethics reviewer, which I believe are serious. Point [1] is resolved. Point [2] about misuse seems valid and harder to argue against.  The data does have value for use in the kind of more benign studies the authors report in the response there. But its very existence could encourage the construction of certain kinds of automated tools for legal judgment prediction, which has been a hotly-debated issue in the NLP community before. Ultimately I will defer to the ethics reviewer on this one, who seems satisfied.

Overall this paper seems like a well-done effort. The main question is whether its utility (modulated by issues with the results) outweighs the risks of putting it out there. Reviewers seem to lean positive on this and I would lean positive as well.

 NAS-bench-Graph is a benchmark for graph neural architecture search (GraphNAS) The main benchmark data is hosted on GitHub with the complete data available on Figshare . The studied problem is novel, but not important/interesting . Different NAS algorithms might have different performances on different problems/tasks/datasets . The empirical evaluation does not quantify meassurement error, making it hard to assess how statistically sound their analysis is .
Gold Metareview 45:
This paper introduces the first NAS benchmarks on graphs. Ratings were quite diverse, with scores of 4,5,6,7,7,8.
The many positive reviewers highlighted that GraphNAS is very relevant and that a benchmark for them would be very useful for the community. The benchmark includes comprehensive evaluations on as many as 9 different datasets, which may also help facilitate research on meta-learning for (Graph)NAS. Initially, the code for creating the benchmark and analysis was not available, which is a no-go for tabular NAS benchmarks, but the authors fixed this in the rebuttal period.
The most negative reviewer, 8asK, appears to not be familiar with tabular NAS benchmarks and their usefulness, and did not react to the discussion about it, as well as to the modification of the paper to highlight it. The other borderline negative review, by reviewer LkTe, had as their main ciriticism that NAS methods should be benchmarked on many spaces, but the point of tabular NAS benchmarks is *not* to provide a conclusive assessment of the performance of NAS methods that holds in general across search spaces (as a "horserace" paper might try to achieve), but rather to facilitate the cheap evaluation of current and future NAS methods on a single search space. For these reasons, I do agree more with the positive reviewers and recommend acceptance of this work as a poster.

 A new portfolio policy network architecture for DRl to exploit cross-asset dependency information . Such a scheme mainly introduces a permutation invariance property, and it is very interesting . The proposed approach is evaluated on three sets of data from the Canadian and US stock markets . The results show the proposed approach outperformed baselines in terms of different metrics such as annual return and Sharpe ratio . The paper develops the first CNN based portfolio optimization network named **WaveCorr** .
Gold Metareview 46:
This paper proposes an architecture of a policy network (WaveCorr) that is particularly effective for portfolio management tasks.  A key observation that leads to the design of WaveCorr is that the dependency across asset should be treated differently from the dependency across time.  The proposed WaveCorr has the property that it is "permutation invariant" with respect to assets, which means that the class of functions that can be represented by WaveCorr is invariant to permutation of assets.  WaveCorr is shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in a portfolio management task.

A major point of discussion was the definition of "permutation invariance".  The reviewers and AC understood the difference between the permutation invariance defined in this paper and that studied in the prior work (the output of a network is insensitive to the permutation of the particular values of the input).  With the definition in this paper, however, a fully connected layer is permutation invariant, but the Corr layer proposed in the paper appears to have more structure.  It is unclear exactly what properties of the Corr layer leads to the performance improvement.

 The focus of this paper is mainly on BERT . Authors find out that previous baselines for ultra-low bit precision quantization are significantly under-trained . Based on the study, they propose a new compression pipeline named XtrmC . The contribution of the paper, while effective, is ad-hoc. The paper lacks a detailed analyses of the computational complexity of the various methods . The authors well addressed the limitations and future research directions .
Gold Metareview 48:
Reviewers agree that this paper presents a systematic study on the impact of hyper-parameters and training strategies of previous works. Based on those empirical observations, they propose a simplified model with layer reduction and single-stage distillation, which do not rely on a complicated and ad-hoc training strategy. Extensive experiments are conducted with thorough comparison with existing works. Authors also clearly point-out their current limitations.

The major concern is that this paper is more focused on discussion of the effectiveness of training strategies in previous methods, while the theoretical contribution is somehow limited. It would be much better if authors could explain their observations (more training epochs is needed while additional distillation stages can be discarded) from a theoretical perspective, although this may be far out of the scope of this work. Nonetheless, this paper presents valuable empirical study over existing Transformer compression methods and may inspire following research; therefore, AC recommends acceptance.

 The paper makes the previously unreported finding that contrastive learning produces "group disentangled" representations and outperform other disentanglement models . Contrastive methods, particularly BYOL, learn disentangle representations with just a change of normalization method in the encoder . The work also proposes a new concept called "Group disentangling", which is a relaxed version of the original disentangles . The authors also claim the dimensions are "group disentangled", although this is only shown on one dataset .
Gold Metareview 49:
The paper provides additional empirical evidence that self-supervised learning methods can help disentangling factors of variation in a dataset. That said, the paper can benefit from better framing and perhaps comparison with existing work (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08850 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00810). Furthermore, the authors acknowledge that there was a bug in their code, which I believe should at least lead to softening the claims about group disentanglement. Accordingly, please consider revising the paper and re-submitting to other venues.

The paper is well-written but it does not contain significant contributions .
Gold Metareview 50:
This paper proposes a methodology to create cheap NAS surrogate benchmarks for arbitrary search spaces. Certainly, the work is interesting and useful, with comprehensive studies to validate such approach. It should be credited as belonging to the first efforts of introducing and comprehensively studying the concept of surrogate NAS benchmarks. In AC's opinion, it is a solid paper that will (or has already) inspire many follow up works. The paper is well written. 

This paper received highly mixed ratings. Although the authors might not see, all reviewers actually participated in the private discussions. Reviewer 1eb8 indicated hesitation in her/his support. Reviewer yTPb stated that if not considering the arXiv complicacy, she/he "would certainly raise score by one level".  AC also reached out to Reviewer yTPb about her/his mentioned possibility of updating scores, and got confirmed that her/his original opinions wasn't changing after rebuttals. Besides, AC agrees the arXiv/NeurIPS complicacy shouldn't brought into the current discussion, and ignored that factor during decision making. 

The main sticking (and considered-as-valid) critique is on the relatively outdated and incomplete selection of baselines. As a benchmark paper, it should capture and diversify the recent methods. For example, the authors might consider adding: https://botorch.org/docs/papers (latest methods in Bayesian Optimization) https://github.com/facebookresearch/LaMCTS (latest methods in Monte Carlo Tree Search) https://facebookresearch.github.io/nevergrad/ (latest methods in Evolutionary algorithms)

Given the above concerns, AC considers this paper to sit on the borderline, and perhaps with pros outweighing the cons. Hence, a weak accept decision is recommended at this moment.

They propose a logit anchoring loss term for fine-tuning models to introduce backdoors while maintaining consistency on clean data . They state that they are the first to propose consistency, including global and instance-wise consistency .
Gold Metareview 51:
This paper proposes measures of consistency between back-doored and clean models, proposes regularization using those consistency measures, and showcases that such trained models indeed exhibit better consistency. Also, it is demonstrated that the fine-tuned model does not deviate too far from the original clean model. The reviewers' comments are all well addressed. Some concerns related to the notion of consistency and how it relates to the detection of backdoors are still left open, but the reviewers seem to be satisfied with the answers. Given the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I propose accept.

 This paper suggests the n-times coverage problem (a natural generalization of set-cover where items need to be covered n>1 times by the sets we choose) and motivates it with an application for the design of COVID vaccines . The problem is shown to be not-submodular, and therefore the most standard methods don't quite work . Authors propose a variant of the set covering problem which aim to formalize peptide-based vaccine design as an optimization problem .
Gold Metareview 52:
The paper introduces the maximum n-times coverage, a new NP-hard (and non-submodular) optimization problem. It is shown that the problem can naturally arise in ML-based vaccine design, and two heuristics are given to solve the problem. The results are used to produce a pan-strain COVID vaccine. 

The reviewers and I think that this is an interesting paper with a compelling application. There were some concerns about theoretical novelty and biological accuracy but these were addressed during the author response period. Given this, I am delighted to recommend acceptance. Please incorporate the feedback in the reviews in the final version of the paper.

 A paper tested a simple idea: when we do large batch training, instead of sampling more training data for each minibatch, we use data augmentation techniques . The authors claim the proposed method has better generalization performance . The improvement on test errors does not look significant . The idea is very simple -- include in your batch M augmentations of the each training sample, effectively this will increase the size of the batch by M . The paper shows that training with large batch size serves as an effective regularization method for deep networks .
Gold Metareview 53:
The authors propose to use large batch training of neural networks, where each batch contains multiple augmentations of each sample. The experiments demonstrate that this leads to better performance compared to training with small batches. However, as noted by Reviewers 2 and 3, the experiments do not convincingly show where the improvement comes from. Considering that the described technique is very simplistic, having an extensive ablation study and comparison to the strong baselines is essential. The rebuttal didn’t address the reviewers' concerns, and they argue for rejection.

 The approach addressed an important challenge in semantic segmentation in medical images: partially labeled images . Specially important in this field (histopathology) The overall performance is not so convincing as stated by the authors . The approach is benchmarked against important baseline approaches, U-Net and DeepLabv3 . The method has a lot of overlap with the DoD-Net paper so I feel the technical novelty of this paper is limited . The experiments are conducted on a dataset which is not publicly available .

While two our of three reviewers pointed out that the method is very similar to a previously published approach, DODNet,  these reviewers still see value in the extensive evaluation presented in this paper, and both suggested weak accept. The first reviewer also increased the score to borderline after the rebuttal owing to additional experiments for evaluation. I also agree with the reviewers that this paper addresses an important problem in the field, i.e.  partially labelled data, and presents extensive evaluation and benchmarking against important baseline approaches, and therefore suggest acceptance of this paper.

All Reviewers agree that the paper has a clear and solid contribution. Furthermore, all of them highlight that the paper has improved significantly after revision. Hence, my recommendation is to ACCEPT the paper. As a brief summary, I highlight below some pros and cons that arose during the review and meta-review processes.

Pros:
- Comparison across network architectures.
- Comparison across a broad range of different data sets.
- Compactness of the representation (few parameters to learn).
- Authors will share code.

Cons:

 This paper introduces two online sequential tests of equality and contrasts for Bernoulli and Poisson process . In simulated studies, the new tests show the speed up in decision making and reduce the opportunity cost in data collection process . This paper proposes a sequential multinomial test where Type I error is controlled through the martingale properties of a variant of the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) Strengths: The design of the test is technically solid and the test a consistent test . Weakness: The assumption on the parameters (line 52 to line 56) about the alternative may not be accurate .
Gold Metareview 57:
While there is no unanimity, the majority is positive and sees the potential value of the approach for machine learning. It is good to mention that the authors did a good job in replying to comments and criticisms, which has clarified a few misunderstandings. Personally I would recommend the authors not to use the confusing terminology between Bayesian and frequentist approaches that are employed in the paper, because it has generated more harm than benefit (at least among those in the discussion here). The theoretical results seem sound and useful and the contribution is good (even if the targeted problem might be seen as too specific by some).

 The authors consider the problem of finding an approximate extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE) of a finite general-sum multiplayer extensive form game under the perfect recall assumption . They propose an accelerated version via optimism of the algorithm by Farina et al. (2019a) The main technical point to obtain this result is to characterize the stability of certain fixed point strategies through a refined perturbation analysis of a structured Markov chain . The improved convergence rate is a clear theoretical contribution and the experiments suggest that a practical implementation of these techniques is possible .
Gold Metareview 58:
This paper builds upon existing works to prove that learning (correlated) equilibrium can be fast, i.e., faster than \sqrt{n} even in extensive form games.

Three reviewers are rather lukewarm, and one reviewer is more positive (but seems less confident in his score). The two major criticisms is that this paper is very difficult to read and that the results might seem rather incremental with respect to the literature.

I tend to agree with both points but the paper still as merits: the reason is that extensive form games are intrinsically way harder than normal form games and they more or less all have a burden of notations. We agreed  that the authors actually did some efforts to make it fit within the page limit. but another a conference or a journal would have been better suited than ICLR.

Our final conclusion is that the result is interesting yet maybe not breathtaking for the ICLR community; we are fairly certain that another venue for this paper will be more appropriate and that it will be accepted in the near future (I can only suggest journals based on the large amount of content and notations, such as OR, MOR, or GEB - yet, conferences such as EC should be more scoped too) . It does not, unfortunately, reach the ICLR bar.

 This paper proposes a method (projUNN) for efficiently training neural networks with parameters that are constrained to be unitary/orthogonal matrices . The main strength of the paper arises from the observation that low rank matrices can accurately approximate gradients .

The proposed methods are simple-yet-effective, and the theoretical results are strong .

As such, it is easy to recommend acceptance, and I will push for this to receive at least a spotlight.  Even so, I urge the authors to make careful revisions for remaining issues raised by the reviewers, and to perform a full pass of their own.

The goals reside in a low-dimensional representation space that is obtained from high-dimensional sensory data . They call their framework Discrete Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (DGRL) The method is simple to implement in existing architectures and uses established approaches that have been developed for some time now . The paper is overall very well written, and the ideas and results are communicated clearly .
Gold Metareview 63:
This paper proposes a discrete and compositional representation of goal states for goal-conditioned RL. The idea is to learn a goal representation via self-supervised learning and discretize the learned representation via VQ-VAE, and finally use the learned goal representation for goal-conditioned RL. The proposed method improves performance on several goal-conditioned RL benchmarks.

All of the reviewers found the idea simple and reasonable, and the results on a variety of benchmarks are quite comprehensive and strong. Although there were concerns around why the proposed discretized representation forms a semantically meaningful latent space and where the improvement comes from, the authors addressed them during the rebuttal period with updated results. All of the reviewers became in favor of the paper as a result. Thus, I recommend accepting this paper.

This submission proposes a method for learning sparse DNNs which consists of three components: First, a "dense" network is maintained and updated in each backwards pass, but the forward pass is done via a sparsified version of the network; sparsification is done via "soft" thresholding; and the sparsity ratio is increased over the course of training. Reviewers noted that each of these components had been previously proposed, and that the state-of-the-art baselines are not actually state-of-the-art anymore. They also noted that the paper read more like a draft and needs substantial improvement. The consensus was therefore to reject.

 This paper proposes a framework for problems where the output has some validity constraints . Authors show that this approach leads to an improvement of 3-5% on the SPOC pseudo-code to code data-set . The recommendation is a "weak accept" though, because the experimental evidence for the technique is not convincing enough to me . The paper introduces a “predict-and-denoise” model for structured prediction, specifically for tasks where output has to adhere to some constraints e.g. natural language, code etc.
Gold Metareview 66:
This work is well written and easy to follow and proposes a novel framework to utilize unlabeled output data. The authors have also given a detailed proof that the denoiser reduces the required complexity of the predictor. However, ultimately the experimental results are somewhat weak and leave doubts as to how effective the approach is. More convincing experimental results such as significant improvements on a well understood task and acknowledging that the approach is mostly useful when combined with pre-training and back translation would improve the work.

Pros
- Well written.
- Technically novel approach to the problem of utilizing unlabeled output data.
- Interesting proof on the reduced complexity requirement for the predictor.

Cons:
- Experimental results are not convincing. Showing significant improvements on a well understood task would be more convincing.
- The approach is only really useful when combined with pre-training or back-translation.

 This work proposes a method for Byzantine learning in a parameter-server setting using asynchronous updates . The motivation for avoiding storing instances on the master node is not well fleshed out in my opinion . The paper proposes a practical stochastic gradient descent for Byzantine distributed learning where some of transmitted gradients are likely to be replaced by arbitrary vectors . When $B = 1$  BASGD is reduced to ASGD. The paper is well written and easy to follow .
Gold Metareview 68:
The authors present BASGD and asynchronous version of SGD that attempts to be robust against byzantine failures/attacks. 
The papers is overall well written and clearly presents the results. Some novelty is present as there have been limited work in asynchronous algorithms for byzantine ML. 

However, there have been several concerns raised by the reviewers, on which I agree, and they have not been fully addressed:
1) the tradeoff between asynchrony and robustness, as BASGD cannot handle the case of a buffer being straggler, which limits some of the novelty in this work
2) issues with the definition of privacy leakage has not been fully addressed
3) some reviewers mentioned the theoretical results being of limited importance, but arguably this is true for other related work in this area. Perhaps a general criticism is valid as to what is the operational value of the proposed guarantees. That is convergence does not exclude a model that has undesirable properties, eg has bad prediction accuracy for a small subset of tasks.
4) Finally, the motivation of the system model of the paper ( eg storing gradients as opposed to instances) paper is of unclear practical relevance, as was raised by multiple reviewers. 

Overall the consensus was that the paper does have merits, however, some of the most major concerns were not properly addressed. This paper can potentially be improved for a future venue.

 This paper proposes a Network-Wise Quantization (NWQ) approach . NWQ arises overfitting and discrete optimization problems . To avoid the overfitting problem in quantized networks, the authors present several training strategies . They conduct thorough ablation studies and experiments on several mainstream networks to fully verify the superiority of the proposed methods . The insight of this paper is straight-forward but very sensible -- quantization errors can cancel each other, and optimizing with a higher granularity can achieve better performance .
Gold Metareview 69:
This paper studies post-training quantization by proposing Network-Wise Quantization (NWQ) an end-to-end quantization approach that takes into account relationships between layers rather than treating layers independently. Using this approach, the paper demonstrates compelling empirical gains across a number of architectures and compression factors. Reviewers recognized the practical success of the approach as demonstrated by these empirical results and praised the clarity of the manuscript. However, there were concerns regarding the novelty of the approach and whether the proposed method is simply a composition of previous methods. While I understand these concerns, I think there is a significant delta between this work and previous approaches, especially when taking into account the markedly improved performance and the challenges of determining how to apply these lines of thinking to end-to-end training. The authors also expanded their discussion of these works in their updated manuscript, clarifying the differences. There were also concerns regarding the hyperparameter tuning, but the authors clarified in their response that the large majority of experiments used a constant set of hyperparameters, suggesting that these results are not simply the effect of tuning. Altogether, I think this paper makes an impactful contribution and will be a valuable addition to the conference.

 This work is about layer-wise training of networks by way of optimizing the IB cost function . The paper attempts to overcome this problem by using a noisy version of the latent compression .

While overall the writing quality of the paper is high, the paper itself is a strong rejection . I believe the analysis is at points flawed, and the experiments are minimal .

This paper does two things. First, it proposes an approach to estimating the mutual information between the input, X, or target label, Y, and an internal representation in a deep neural network, L, using MINE (for I(Y;L)) or a variation on MINE (for I(X;L)) and noise regularization (estimating I(X;L+ε), where ε is isotropic Gaussian white noise) to avoid the problem that I(X;L) is infinite for deterministic networks and continuous X. Second, it attempts to validate the information bottleneck theory of deep learning (Tishby and Zaslavsky, 2015) by exploring an approach to training DNNs that optimizes the information bottleneck Lagrangian, I(Y;L) − βI(X;L+ε), layerwise instead of using cross-entropy and backpropagation. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show improvements for the layerwise training over cross-entropy training. The penalty on I(X;L+ε) is described as being analogous to weight decay. The reviewers raised a number of concerns about the paper, the most serious of which is that the claim that the layerwise training results validate the information bottleneck theory of deep learning is too strong. In the AC's opinion, R1's critique that "[i]f the true mutual information is infinite and the noise regularized estimator is only meant for comparative purposes, why then are the results of the training trajectories interpreted so literally as estimates of the true mutual information?" is critical, and the authors' reply that "this quantity is in fact a more appropriate measure for “compactness” or “complexity” than the mutual information itself" undermines their claim that they are validating the information bottleneck theory of deep nets because the information bottleneck theory claims to be using mutual information. The AC also suggests that if the authors wish to continue this work and submit it to another venue, they (1) discuss the fact that MINE estimates only a lower bound that may be quite loose in practice and (2) say in their experimental section whether or not the variance of the regularizing noise was tuned as a hyperparameter, and if so, how results varied with different amounts of noise. Finally, the AC regrets that only one reviewer participated in the discussion (in a very minimal way), despite the reviewers' receiving several reminders that the discussion is a defining feature of the ICLR review process.

 The problem studied in this paper is very interesting and the proposed approach is technically sound . My main concern is the actionability of the results and their significance . In active learning setting in some cases comparisons are more effective than argmax . Theorem 4.3 shows that in the 1D setting the $\arg\max$ oracle has the same complexity as the label comparison oracle . In the active pool-based setting, that the sample complexity of label comparison is actually smaller than the lower bound for the $O^{\tilde}$ .

 Counterfactual Generative Network (CGN) is basically "modular" generative adversarial network . Can be used to generate high-quality counterfactual images with direct control over of factors of variations determining the content of an image shape, texture, and background . These generated samples obtained by independently and uniformly sampling over factors of variation can be . used to train a classifier to achieve out-of-domain robustness . The paper proposes a new generative model that generates images from 3 seperate aspects .
Gold Metareview 72:
The paper presents a "conceptual  advance connecting causality, disentangled representation learning, invariant representations and robust classification". Authors propose to decompose the image generation process to independent mechanism that can be composed (foreground masks (shapes), forground texture, and backgrounds), allowing for a specific image to generate counterfactuals , by changing some variations factors, while keeping other fixed. One can use interventional data to augment classifiers, this can lead in certain cases to improvement in accuracy and in other in improving the robustness. 

There was concerns about the clarity of the paper regarding the structured causal model considered and its applicability beyond image generation, experimental protocol for choosing hyperparameters (loss scaling and ratios of real data and interventional samples ) and some missing references. The rebuttal of the authors and their updated paper reflected comprehensively all those concerns and addressed them, highlighting limitations of the method and adding more examples of its failures. 

I liked the ideas and concepts in  this paper , and it will be exciting to generalize such generative approach to other domains, this  work is a first step. I think it will be good addition to ICLR program

 Knowledge tracing is a longstanding task in educational data mining and has been tackled by various studies . This paper proposed that three data augmentation methods (along with different types of regularization losses) can be applied to boost the performance of existing deep neural network models for knowledge tracing . The novelty part is limited since the proposed methods such as insertion, deletion and replacements are intuitive and also seen in prior works in NLP . The monotonicity constraint is specific to the knowledge tracing task though .
Gold Metareview 73:
The paper proposes new techniques for improving the generalization ability of deep learning models for Knowledge Tracing (KT). Instead of designing more sophisticated models, the paper investigates simple data augmentation techniques that can be applied to train existing models. In particular, three different augmentation strategies are proposed based on replacement, insertion, and deletion in the training data. These strategies are then applied with appropriate regularization loss ensuring consistency and monotonicity in the training process. Extensive experiments are performed using three popular neural models for KT and four publicly available datasets. Overall, the paper studies an interesting problem in an important application domain of online education. The results are promising and open up several exciting follow-up research directions to explore more complex data augmentation techniques for KT.

I want to thank the authors for actively engaging with the reviewers during the discussion phase and sharing their concerns about the quality of the reviews.  The reviewers generally appreciated the paper's ideas; however, there was quite a bit of spread in the reviewers' assessment of the paper (scores: 4, 5, 6, 7). In summary, this is a borderline paper, and unfortunately, the final decision is a rejection. The reviewers have provided detailed and constructive feedback for improving the paper. In particular, the authors should incorporate the reviewers' feedback to better position the work w.r.t. the existing literature on data augmentation and state of the art results, better motivate the data augmentation strategies in the context of educational applications possibly through additional data analysis, and add more ablation studies w.r.t. the hyperparameters associated with data augmentation. This is exciting and potentially impactful work, and we encourage the authors to incorporate the reviewers' feedback when preparing future revisions of the paper.

 A paper addresses the problem that widely established machine learning datasets have a significant bias towards higher-income countries . So, the authors present DollarStreet, a dataset that of everyday household items from around the world with a variety of countries and incomes . The only possible weakness I might see lies in the reliance of a pre-existing dataset . The dataset includes 38,479 images of 289 common household objects photographed from 404 homes across 63 nations . Each image has full demographic information such as global region, country name and monthly income .
Gold Metareview 78:
The AC has taken into account all strengths and weaknesses mentioned by reviewers in making a recommendation for this paper. Here is the summary of what was considered in carefully considering a final decision:

* Reviewers agree that the presented resource, the Dollar Street dataset, addresses a need for models that can be held more accountable in terms of geographic diversity and demographic diversity. 
* There is generally no issues in terms of methodology or soundness of the proposed resource.
* Unfortunately, experiments on demonstrating the usefulness of this resource are limited, and largely replicate what was already found in Devries et al. 2019, a workshop paper at CVPR from three years ago which also used the same source of data -- and at the same scale. The analysis in this previous paper in some way go further by matching image categories using human evaluators individually for each image -- as pointed out by reviewer dcyB.
* The dataset was downloaded from a third party's website and as such the authors had no control in how the images were collected, nor there was any effort to enhance this resource in terms of annotations, diversity or size.
* The dataset size is 38k images which is a rather small dataset for training or enhancing a model, and its use would be limited mostly as a benchmark dataset. As a benchmark however experiments seem limited as pointed by reviewer eAoC. An experiment on training on this dataset and evaluating on this dataset is performed only with a Resnet network, however it is hard to assess what is the significance of this experiment. 

There are various suggestions made by reviewers below that would enhance the quality of this paper. Despite shortcomings, reviewers are still enthusiastic to see this dataset in an easy to use format as a benchmark. I also strongly suggest the authors to revise their section on licensing where it says "Training machine learning models on public domain work is widely accepted legally." as it does not seem appropriate for this paper to be making determinations or recommendations as to what is considered legal or not.

 The authors have proposed a well-motivated contrastive learning method for solving goal-conditioned RL tasks . The method removes the need for auxiliary losses or data augmentations for representation learning . This is especially useful for the pixel-based environments, for which the authors have shown performance gains in many continuous-control tasks . This work may have the potential to benefit the RL, representation learning, and robotics communities . I think this is a decent paper and I would vote for acceptance .
Gold Metareview 80:
How to design RL algorithms that directly acquire good representations? This paper gives an answer that contrastive representation learning can be cast as a goal-conditioned RL using the inner product of learned representations.
The technical novelty of this paper is sound, with the thorough theoretic motivation of the proposed method and solid experiments. The presentation of this paper is also satisfactory.
All the reviewers provided positive feedback on this paper. I also enjoy reading this paper.

 The paper explores an interesting semi-supervised learning (SSL) setting in which the unlabeled data contain not only the seen class but also novel classes . The proposed method is end to end and achieves significant improvement on ImageNet . The design of the proposed method seems reasonable, and it works well in the experiments with several datasets . The writing could be better and the notations better defined . The study tackles an important problem that would occur in real-world applications .
Gold Metareview 81:
This work addresses a novel and important real-world setting for semi-supervised learning – the open-world problem where unlabeled data may contain novel classes that are not seen in labeled data.  The paper provides an approach by combining three loss functions: a supervised cross-entropy loss, a pairwise cross-entropy loss with adaptive uncertainty margin, and a regularization towards uniform distribution.  

The authors were responsive to reviewers’ comments and have respectively improved their paper by adding experiments, including an ablation study of each component of the objective function, study of the effect regularization on unbalanced class distributions, reporting accuracy on pseudo-labels.  While two reviewers have slightly increased their scores, some concerns still remain.

This is a borderline paper, and after some discussion and calibration, we decided that the work in its current form does not quite meet the bar for acceptance.

Generated Summary 82:
 The motivation of bridging the gap between offline algorithms and their online counterparts is clear and practical . The paper makes use of algorithms that can view entire time-series to train an online algorithm . The online algorithms are not trained to produce the outputs of the offline algorithms directly . Instead windows of the outputs are mapped to class labels using a hand-crafted mapping specific to the domain . They are then trained to predict the class labels of the current window and progressively forward-looking windows .
Gold Metareview 82:
## A Brief Summary
This paper uses offline algorithms that can see the entire time-series to approximate the online algorithms that can only view the past time-series. The way this is done is basically, the offline algorithm is used to provide discrete class targets to train the online algorithm. The paper presents results on synthetic and historical stock market data.

## Key Takeaways and Thoughts
Overall, I think the problem setup is very interesting. However, as pointed out by reviewers gii5 and EgW5, due to the lack of baselines, it is tough to compare the proposed algorithm against other approaches, and this paper's evaluation is challenging. I would recommend the authors include more ablations in the future version of the paper and baselines and address the other issues pointed out above by the reviewers.

Generated Summary 83:
 A paper proposed a method to decide when to ask for expert’s help to improve the task performance of embodied agents . Instead of using heuristics, e.g. model confusion, or expanding the action space of the embodied agent, this paper learns a separate policy on top of the decisions of off-the-shelf embodied agents using reinforcement learning . The Ask4Help policy can be adapted at inference time to different users' preference regarding the frequency of being "disturbed" by the agent to answer it .
Gold Metareview 83:
I thank the authors for their submission and active participation in the discussions. This paper introduces a method for learning a policy that can ask an expert for help, i.e., to obtain the expert action. On the positive side, reviewers found the method to be general [uya8], original and significant [gw2r], intruiging in terms of being able to reuse an existing policy [HGan], and tackling an important problem [rsmr,bRWC], and the paper to be clear [uya8,gw2r,rsmr,bRWC]. In terms of negative points, reviewers were concerned about the novelty [bRWC], unimpressive qualitative results despite strong quantitative results [bRWC], and issues with the range of baselines [bRWC,rsmr] and ablations considered [uya8]. Overall, the paper is borderline. However, bRWC indicated they would raise their score but I don't see this being reflected. Furthermore, in my view reviewer rsmr's concerns regarding baselines and ablations has been addressed by the author rebuttal. Thus, I am siding with reviewers gw2r and HGan, and recommend acceptance. However, I very strongly encourage the authors to further improve their paper based on the reviewer feedback, in particular the points raised by reviewer bRWC regarding the importance of the Success Prediction component of the method.

Empirically, the effectiveness of their approach is shown via experiments on synthetic SBM graphs .

The authors indicated that it takes seconds to compute it on 36 cores machine, but it’s not clear how scalable this method is .
Gold Metareview 85:
The paper proposes a new defense against adversarial attacks on graphs using a reweighting scheme based on Ricci-flow. Reviewers highlighted that the paper introduces interesting ideas and that the use of Ricci-curvature/flow is a novel and promising contribution. Reviewers also recognized that the paper has significantly improved after rebuttal and clarified some aspects of their initial reviews.

However, there exist still concerns around the current version of the manuscript. In particular, important aspects of the method and algorithm, as well as some design choices are currently unclear. This includes evaluating and discussing robustness, training method, and practicality/improvements in real-world scenarios. I agree with the majority of the reviewers that the current version requires an additional revision to iron out the aforementioned issues. However, I also agree with the reviewers that the overall idea is promising and I'd encourage the authors to revise and resubmit their work with considering the feedback from this round of reviews.

 This paper addresses the problem of global rigid registration which is a fundemental problem in computer vision or graphics . It seems they have got a big improvement over the DeepGMR and DCP method . The writing is rather unclear and the paper is difficult to follow . The proposed method follows a DCP pipeline except that it performs point cloud reconstruction as well as self-supervised region segmentation . The pipeline first computes per-point features, then proposes a transformation based on those features . The pipelines are weighted using a predicted weight and combined into a final global transformation .

Post discussion update
------------------------

The authors completed a rebuttal that addressed all of the reviewers' critiques, and also uploaded a revised and improved manuscript. The most significant improvement seems to be the addition of a small related work section in the introduction and a limitation plus future work section at the end of the paper. However, since the final paper has an 8 page limit, the current 9-page manuscript will need to be shortened. 

The clarifications seemed to sway two of the reviewers toward increasing their ratings. Generally, it's clear that although this is a non-standard paper, it raises interesting and potentially provocative points that would be great for the CORL community to discuss. Therefore, I am recommending acceptance.



Original review
----------------


This paper addresses the HRI challenge of measuring how well a robot has learned a user's reward function. It describes two main types of measures---parameter-based and reward-based---and provides both theoretical and empirical examples of the shortcomings of each. 


Strengths
* This seems like the type of paper that would be useful to assign in an HRI course or give to a new grad student, because it clearly explains the different measures and provides a comparison of them.

* Reviewers noted that the issues brought up by this paper are important and very relevant to current approaches. The paper is timely.

* Reviewers agreed that paper balances well between theory and empirical examples. 

* The paper was well written and easy to understand.


Weaknesses

* The main critique is that reviewers feel that the paper doesn't go deeply enough into the discussion of what to do with these findings. How should robotics researchers use this information to design better measures? In what cases are these measures likely to fail, or to be accurate? Section 6 poses such questions, but it would add substantially to the novelty of the paper if there was some suggestion of where to go from here.  

* Although the paper bills itself as a survey, reviewers noted that it doesn't provide much of a discussion of related work. Reviewers also provided additional citations that address some of the issues brought up regarding current measures of performance. 

* A couple of reviewers questioned the connection to robot learning in particular.

* There is no limitations statement, which is a required component.

 SwinTrack adopts the classic siamese structure, and uses Swin Transformer for both feature extraction and fusion of template and search region . A special motion token encodes the past trajectory is introduced to further boost the tracking performance . The proposed method is technically sound and achieves SOTA performance on major SOT benchmarks . The idea to use SwinTransformer instead of a CNN in the branches seems to be novel . The paper addresses the problem of general object tracking, where the target object is given during test time .
Gold Metareview 88:
Authors present a method for single object tracking (SOT) that is entirely comprised of transformers. The architecture is simple: 

1) Swin is used to generate embeddings for both template and search region
2) Embeddings are concatenated
3) An encoder transformer performs MHSA of the embeddings.
4) A decoder performs cross-attention from search tokens to template tokens and a special "motion token" which is constructed from a linear operation over the prior motion trajectory relative to the frame. 
5) Output token is fed to final layers that perform IoU aware classification and bounding box regression.

Evaluations are performed on 5 SOT datasets, achieving SOTA on all of them.


Pros:
- [AC/R] Important problem, technically sound, and new SOTA on this task.
- [AC/R] New motion token approach is novel and provides significant improvement.
- [AC/R] Simple and elegant architecture
- [AC/R] Insightful discussions
- [AC/R] Clearly written and easy to follow
- [AC/R] Interesting ablations
- [AC/R] High frame rate

Cons:
- [R] Low novelty of transformer approach, but this is negated by the novelty of the motion token.
- [R] Details regarding pretraining are missing. Authors provide in response.
- [R] Motivation of motion token design is not clear. Authors provided further ablations of different implementations of the motion token, showing the current form performs best.
- [R] Provide additional details regarding where and how SwinTrack outperforms other approaches on the benchmarks. Authors provided additional granularity of performance stratifications within the LaSOT benchmark.
- [R] Add more recent high performing trackers. Authors added several methods published in 2022.
- [R] Some additional questions about various details were posed by reviewers, which will all answered by the authors. 

The single reviewer with reject recommendation changed to accept in their comments after the discussion period but did not update their score. Given unanimous agreement on accept, AC recommendation is accept.

The authors study representations obtained from image classifiers and contrast the classic training with adversarial training, so-called non-robust and robust networks, respectively. The authors primarily use the CKA metric on CIFAR10 and subsets of ImageNet2012 provide several novel insights on "salient pitfalls" in robust networks which suggest that robust representations are less specialized with a weaker block structure, early layers in robust networks are largely unaffected by adversarial examples as the representations seem similar for benign vs. perturbed inputs, deeper layers overfit during robust learning, and that models trained to be robust to different threat models have similar representations.

The reviewers agreed that these contributions are interesting to the larger community and that the presentation of the results is clear and straightforward. The main issues raised by the reviewers were carefully addressed in the rebuttal. Please update the manuscript as discussed.

 This paper tackles the problem of curriculum learning and presents a new technique (boosted CRL) The authors propose to use the sum of residuals trained on each task for knowledge transfer . The basic idea is to "learn" a residual for each task, modeling in this way how the tasks differ . The major drawback is the empirical evaluation of the algorithm . The authors show both theoretically and empirically the effectiveness of the approach over standard CRL . The paper proposes a new curriculum for RL method .
Gold Metareview 90:
The paper proposes a novel curriculum learning method for RL based on the concept of boosting. The proposed method builds on the curriculum value-based RL framework and uses boosting to reuse action-values from previous tasks when solving the current task. The method is analyzed theoretically in terms of approximation accuracy and convergence. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The reviewers acknowledged the importance of the studied problem setting and generally appreciated the results. I want to thank the authors for their detailed responses that helped in answering some of the reviewers' questions and increased their overall assessment of the paper. At the end of the discussion phase, there was a clear consensus that the paper should be accepted. The reviewers have provided detailed feedback in their reviews, and we strongly encourage the authors to incorporate this feedback when preparing a revised version of the paper.

 The authors notice that entropy regularized optimal transport produces an upper bound of a certain model likelihood . Then the authors claim it is possible to leverage that upper bound to come up with a measure of 'sample likelihood' The assumption made by the authors that "generator is injective" is problematic . It is very confusing when the authors mentioned the negative Shannon entropy . The authors failed to discuss their paper with "ON THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS of DECODERBASED GENERATIVE MODELS", which uses AIS to estimate the likelihood .
Gold Metareview 91:
The paper's strength is in that it shows the log likelihood objective is lower bounded by a GAN objective plus an entropy term. The theory is novel (but it seems to relate closely to the work https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02771.) The main drawback the reviewer raised includes a) it's not clear how tight the lower bound is; b) the theory only applies to a particular subcase of GANs --- it seems that the only reasonable instance that allows efficient generator is the case where Y = G(x)+\xi where \xi is Gaussian noise. The authors addressed the issue a) with some new experiments with linear generators and quadratic loss, but it lacks experiments with deep models which seems to be necessary since this is a critical issue. Based on this, the AC decided to recommend reject and would encourage the authors to add more experiments on the tightness of the lower bound with bigger models and submit to other top venues.

The paper proposes an interesting step in the direction of neuro-symbolic reasoning. While there is no consensus among reviewers about the key novelty of the method, all acknowledge the interest of the direction. All of them also recognize that the submission improved greatly during the discussion phase: clarification of motivations, of experimental settings and results, of discussion with previous work.

However, despite those improvements, the submission is not yet ready for publication at ICLR. We encourage the authors to use the very detailed reviews and comments to improve the work. In particular, we encourage them to pay attention at three aspects:

1/ Comparison with large language models: the discussion wrt T5 is important. A key motivation for the proposed model is that it is bringing information and elements for QA (or other reasoning tasks) that purely scaling up language models can not bring. Or maybe they can bring the same kind of improvement but at a much lower computational cost. In any case, this is a very important point to justify the interest of such approach, and neuro-symbolic reasoning overall, empirically.

2/ Using GPT2 (or equivalent): the discussion on using GPT-2 for generating new facts is key too. It is essential to bring this description from appendix to the core of the paper. But more discussion are expected.  For instance, what if GPT-2 generates facts that are false and lead to answering and justifying a wrong answer? In other words, how does it impact the integrity of the contextualized KG? This is an essential point that needs to be worked on more thoroughly. 

3/ Overall there have been a lot of discussion to improve the motivations and the contributions. But they are not reflected in the paper necessarily. Following R2, we encourage the authors to "refocus the existing version (e.g., from vague discussion about neural-symbolic models towards establishing solid comparison to the most related previous work in various sections of the submission)"

Although the reviewers acknowledge that the paper addresses a relevant topic, proposes an effective method, and is well written, after reading the authors' feedback and discussing their concerns, the reviewers reached a consensus about rejecting this paper in its current form. They feel that the contribution is too incremental and that the experimental comparisons are somehow unfair.

I suggest the authors take into consideration the reviewers' suggestions while preparing an updated version of their paper for one of the forthcoming machine learning conferences.

The paper's initial evaluation was below par, but the author feedback helped clarify several crucial points after which two of the reviewers increased their scores by a point, bringing the current evaluation to borderline. 

The paper addresses a relevant and challenging problem in the RL domain. However, in my opinion, from the reviewers' and authors' remarks and from my own reading of the paper, there are concerns that need to be addressed before the paper can be publication worthy. Primary among these is the quantum of novelty -- as many reviews point out, the key idea of viewing an episodic trajectory as a multivariate (vector) sample for running hypothesis tests is not novel in itself, as is the claim that new tests have been devised. Another crucial issue is the (parametric) assumption of normality for the episodic reward sequence which is not adequately justified in the paper -- even a two time-step trajectory with normal rewards per state transition can exhibit a mixture-of-Gaussians type reward distribution for the second state, breaking the assumption. As it transpired from the reviews of Reviewer4, reducing environment shift/degradation to just a mean change problem, without even considering a change in the variances (2nd order statistics), seems to be too stylized to be effective. There are other, nonparametric approaches in statistics based on testing for changes in the distribution function (kernel density estimation approaches, for instance), which could perhaps be applied without normality assumptions and yield favourable results. The experimental results for detection delay often show significant overlaps of the delay distributions for different procedures (e.g., Hotelling vs. Mean vs. UDT etc.), which does not indicate an advantage of the proposed method. 

I would urge the author(s) to assimilate the feedback and delve deeper as to why and how parametric procedures based on normality assumptions may or may not succeed, so as to significantly strengthen the theoretical and practical message of this work.

The reviewers raised a common concern regarding the lack of focus on the actual usefulness of the librabry in improving the 
performance of the models that is applied on. A common concern was the lack of performance plots compared to other alternatives. 
In the response the authors have done a rather thorough job of addressing the reviewers comments and
adding material in the supplementary. However, given the current presentation, the manuscript needs a considerable amount of  rewriting to incorporate the suggested changes into the main paper. As it is, I don't think ICLR is the right venue for the manuscript.  It might reach its audience better in venues like SysMl or PyCon also suggested by a reviewer.

 An attention mechanism for the policy and value prediction neural network columns of the A3C model based on the convolutional LSTM (Xingjian et al., 2015) evaluated the proposed attention mechanism on three selected ATARI games (namely, Breakout, SpaceInvader, and Ms.Pacman) They show that the attention mechanism generates intuitive visual attention in decision-making . This article proposes to include an attention mechanism to Deep RL (focusing on actor-critic architectures), to provide a visual "explanation" of the learned policy .
Gold Metareview 97:
The paper proposes a method to generate attention masks to interpret the performance of RL agents. Results are presented on a few ATARI games. Reviewers unanimously vote for rejecting the papers. R1, R3 give a score of 5, whereas R4, R5 give a score of 4. Their concerns are best explained in their own words: 

R1 says, "The use of attention maps to analyze and explain deep neural networks is not new in itself, and learning attention maps to improve vision tasks is not new either."

R3 says, "the analysis of the learned attention masks seems selective. Some automatic metrics or systematic studies of different game categories (shooting, maze-like, and ball-and-paddle) may shed light on the learned attention's general property."

R5 says, "I am still not convinced by the quality of the provided visual explanations nor am I convinced that the attention is well correlated with the current frame (the additional experiments provided do help somewhat in this regard, but are not extensive and reasonably inconclusive"

In their rebuttal, to address R1's concern authors suggested that the use of attention on both value and policy networks is novel. This is not sufficient, because it does not show why such attention maps are more useful than ones proposed by prior work. As suggested by reviewers, a systematic study or a human study clearly showing that the proposed method adds more interpretability is critical. However, this is missing.  In response to R3, the authors provided experiments on more games. But this is not the point -- because it's not about the number of environments in which experiments are provided, but rather the nature of the analysis that is performed. Finally, R5 comments that it's unclear whether attention actually provided interpretability or not. 

Due to the lack of convincing analysis that demonstrates the utility of the proposed method in advancing the understanding of decisions made by RL agents, I recommend that the paper be rejected.

 A paper proposes a new algorithm on learning noisy datasets by transforming class labels into pairwise similarity labels . The paper addresses the problem of learning with noisy labels by transforming the original category classification task into a semantic-similarity prediction task . The proposed Class2Simi provides a framework to improve existing learning methods . The noise rate for the noisy similarity labels is lower than that of the noisy class labels . In addition, the paper is well written with good organization .
Gold Metareview 98:
The paper's stated contributions are:

(1) a new perspective on learning with label noise, which reduces the problem to a similarity learning (Ie, pairwise classification) task

(2) a technique leveraging the above to learn from noisy similarity labels, and a theoretical analysis of the same

(3) empirical demonstration that the proposed technique surpasses baselines on real-world benchmarks

Reviewers agreed that (1) is an interesting new perspective that is worthy of study. In the initial set of reviews, there were concerns about (2) and (3); for example, there were questions on whether the theoretical analysis studies the "right" quantity (pointwise vs pairwise loss), and a number of questions on the experimental setup and results (Eg, the computational complexity of the technique). Following a lengthy discussion, the authors clarified some of these points, and updated the paper accordingly.

At the conclusion of the discussion, three reviewers continued to express concerns on the following points:

- *Theoretical justification*. Following Theorem 3, the authors assert that their results "theoretically justifies why the proposed method works well". The analysis indeed provides some interesting properties of the reduction, such as the fact that it preserves learnability (Appendix F), and that the "total noise" is reduced (Theorem 2). However, a complete theoretical justification would involve guaranteeing that the quantity of interest (Ie, the clean pointwise classification risk) is guaranteed to be small under the proposed technique. Such a guarantee is lacking. 
  - This is not to suggest that such a guarantee is easy -- as the authors note, this might involve a bound that relates pointwise and pairwise classification in multi-class settings, and such bounds have only recently been shown for binary problems -- or necessary for their method being practical useful (per discussion following Theorem 3). Nonetheless, without such a bound, there are limits to what the current theory justifies about the technique's performance in terms of the final metric of interest.

- *Comparison to SOTA*. Reviewers noted that the gains of the proposed technique are often modest, with the exception of CIFAR-100 with high noise. Further, the best performing results are significantly worse than those reported in two recent works, namely, Iterative-CV and DivideMix. The authors responded to the former in the discussion, and suggested that they might be able to combine results with the latter. While plausible, given that the latter sees significant gains (Eg, >40% on CIFAR-100), concrete demonstration of this point is advisable: it is not immediately apparent to what extent the gains of the proposed technique seen on "simple" methods (Eg, Forward) would translate more "complex" ones (Eg, DivideMix).
  - In the response, the authors also mentioned that (at least the initial batch of) the experiments are intended to be a proof-of-concept. This would be perfectly acceptable for a work with a strong theoretical justification. However, per above, this point is not definitive.

- *Creation of Clothing1M*. The authors construct a variant of Clothing1M which merges the classes 3 and 5. Given that prior work compares methods on the original data, and that this potentially reflects noise one may encounter in some settings, it is advisable to at least report results on the original, unmodified version.

- *Issues with clarity*. There are some grammatical issues (Eg, "is exact the"), typos (Eg, "over 3 trails"), notational inconsistencies (Eg, use of C for # of classes in Sec 2, but then c in Sec 3.1), and imprecision in explanation (Eg, Sec 3.2 could be clearer what precise relationships are used from [Hsu et al. 2019]).
  - These are minor but ought to be fixed with a careful proof-read.

Cumulatively, these points suggest that the work would be served by further revision and review. The authors are encouraged to incorporate the reviewers' detailed comments.

It involves predicting partner-specific protein interface contacts (i.e., inter-protein residue-residue contacts) given the 3D tertiary structures of two proteins as input . The proposed method is validated on two benchmarking datasets .
Gold Metareview 100:
This paper presents a novel neural network architecture to predict interacting residues among two interacting proteins, and evaluates its performance on benchmarks. While the reviews were initially mixed, there has been a productive discussion and significant improvements in the paper during the discussion, including in particular much needed clarifications about the proposed methods, and more experimental results with an ablation study to better assess the benefits of various design choices. While no reviewer is willing to champion this paper as a "strong accept", due to the relatively modest novelty compared to existing methods, there is a consensus towards "weak accept" given the final quality of the work presented and potential usefulness of the method for the problem tackled.

 The paper presents a pre-training scheme (APT) for RL with two components: contrastive representation learning and particle based entropy maximization . Experiments done in DeepMind Control Suite (DMControl) and Atari suite to show improved performance and data efficiency . The algorithm iterates between minimizing a contrastive loss and maximizing an intrinsic reward derived from a k-NN entropy estimation of the state distribution . Then, authors empirically evaluate the method over a set of visual Mujoco tasks and Atari games .
Gold Metareview 101:
The authors propose a particle-based entropy estimate for intrinsic motivation for pre-training an RL agent to then perform in an environment with rewards. As the reviewers discussed, and also mentioned in their reviews, this paper bears stark similarity to work of 5 months ago, presented at the ICML 2020 Lifelong ML workshop, namely, "A Policy Gradient Method for Task-Agnostic Exploration", Mutti et al, 2020--MEPOL. What is novel here is the adaptation of this entropy estimate to form an intrinsic reward via a contrastive representation and the subsequent demonstration on standardized RL environments.  The authors have added a comparison to MEPOL, and in these experiments, APT outperforms this method, sometimes by some margin. Unfortunately this work does not meet the bar for acceptance relative to other submissions.


Generated Summary 102:
 The authors propose an efficient method to perform message passing on a truncated Gaussian kernel CRF . The experiments seem to show performance in par with the FullCRF on decoupled training . The main points of this paper are the use of the convolution operator to perform the message passing mean field inference . Using this operation allows us to get away from the permutohedral lattice and yet allows speed up of 100x . This also means, that training will be able to done faster .
Gold Metareview 102:
The authors replace the large filtering step in the permutohedral lattice with a spatially varying convolutional kernel. They show that inference is more efficient and training is easier.

In practice, the synthetic experiments seem to show a greater improvement than appears in real data.  There are concerns about the clarity, lack of theoretical proofs, and at times overstated claims that do not have sufficient support.

The ratings before the rebuttal and discussion were 7-4-6.  After, R1 adjusted their score from 6 to 4.  R2 initially gave a 7 but later said "I think the authors missed an opportunity here. I rated it as an accept, because I saw what it could have been after a good revision. The core idea is good, but fully agree with R1 and R3 that the paper needs work (which the authors were not willing to do). I checked the latest revision (as of Monday morning). None of R3's writing/claims issues are fixed, neither were my additional experimental requests, not even R1's typos." There is therefore a consensus among reviewers for reject.

 The paper examines the use of STE for learning simple one-layer convolutional networks with binary activations and non overlapping patches . In this setting, the gradients are 0 almost everywhere ( gradient of sign(x) hence it is not clear how to use gradient descent . The approach studied here is to instead use the gradient of an alternative function such as ReLU or identity . The paper is fairly clear, despite being quite technical, but the ordering and layout could definitely be improved .
Gold Metareview 103:
The paper contributes to the understanding of straight-through estimation for single hidden layer neural networks, revealing advantages for ReLU and clipped ReLU over identity activations.  A thorough and convincing theoretical analysis is provided to support these findings.  After resolving various issues during the response period, the reviewers concluded with a unanimous recommendation of acceptance.  Valid criticisms of the presentation quality were raised during the review and response period, and the authors would be well served by continuing to improve the paper's clarity.

 The reviewer finds the paper is timely and interesting but thinks the paper needs to be improved . The authors propose a role diversity metric to quantify the difference between agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning . The metric is used to inform the use of communication, parameter sharing, communication mechanism, and other MARL algorithmic decisions . The reviewer says the paper does not do a convincing job at showing that the roles are core to “cooperative training strategies for multiagent RL”
Gold Metareview 104:
This paper proposes a Role Diversity metric, meant to quantify how different roles are in a multi-agent RL setting. There's actually three versions of this metric, or three aspects (the distinction is not entirely clear to this area chair).

The reviewers are generally not very enthusiastic about the paper, with scores hovering at or just below the acceptance threshold. There has been extensive discussion between reviewers and authors, but there a sense that there is confusion about the exact purpose and contribution of the paper. This is reinforced by the authors' "letter to area chair", which outlines several ways the reviewers have not gotten the message. Reading the paper, it appears to me that the root cause is that the authors are indeed not communicating clearly what the paper contributes and why. It is, after all, the authors' responsibility that the reviewers understand the work. My own impression is that the text is dense and not particularly easy to get through. Perhaps the authors are simply trying to cram too many contributions into a single conference paper? This is a classic error which leads to hard-to-read papers. In addition to this, there is a lingering concern about the generalizability of the proposed methods.

I think the authors need to work more on their presentation, and perhaps reconsider which parts to include in their paper and exactly which measure they want to send, before they submit to another venue.

 The paper proposes a novel factorisation approach and uses recurrent networks . The technical parts are quite poorly written . Some of the writing is "locally" clear, but one large, poorly-organized section makes the whole thing confusing (details below) The quality of the actual output is fine, and to my ears not better than-- existing polyphonic systems such as the ones below . The paper views the problem as modelling a probability distribution over musical scores .
Gold Metareview 105:
This paper proposes novel recurrent models for polyphonic music composition and demonstrates the approach with qualitative and quantitative evaluations as well as samples. The technical parts in the original write-up were not very clear, as noted by multiple reviewers. During the review period, the presentation was improved. Unfortunately the reviewer scores are mixed, and are on the lower side, mainly because of the lack of clarity and quality of the results.

 This paper proposes a deep-learning framework to model shape deformations, especially in the context of modifying a surface . The motivation is that prominent methods like ARAP are restrictive in their results, partly due to pure geometric action . This paper deals with the problem of surface deformation by training a Transformer network on point cloud . The key idea is, they adopt a canonical model or space as often used in human modeling and design a backward and forward deformation network to deform from any source model to target model .

While some of the scores on this paper are mixed, even the negative reviews highlight the quality and interest of the work and have specific (and somewhat debatable) technical concerns.  Overall, the AE recommends accept, especially in light of the detailed and thoughtful responses during the rebuttal phase.

In the camera ready, the authors are encouraged to see if they can squeeze some of the new results (e.g., transfer learning attempt in Figure 6 and comparisons to Shapeflow) in the main body of the paper, where they're more likely to be noticed.

Generated Summary 108:
 This paper studies problems of classification and object detection from natural image datasets in a continual learning setting . It is assumed that a memory buffer of a certain size is available to store data in . The strategy used by the paper is to fill this memory buffer with compressed data samples (with JPEG) rather than the original images . Such compression introduces a quantity-quality trade-off, which this paper empirically analyses . Using a naive technique of data compression with a properly selected quality, the proposed method can achieve SOTA performance in a time-efficient and plug-and-play way .
Gold Metareview 108:
This works considers limitations of rehearsal-based methods in the context of continual learning (classification and object detection). Rehearsal-based methods provide a strong baseline, but a loss in predictive performance arises when the memory is limited in size. The authors propose to leverage compression (JPEG) to increase the number of data (images) stored in the memory. The approach is evaluated in the context of an autonomous driving application.

The additional experiments conducted by the authors were highly appreciated and helped clarify open questions (e.g., class-incremental learning set-up, DPP objective to determine size of the memory, quantity vs quality of compressed data, etc.). The authors addressed the issues raised by three out of four reviewers, who did not have further comments. The remaining reviewer found that the methodological contributions of this paper, namely of using compression in the context of CL, was pretty straightforward. However, the authors addressed the concerns raised by the reviewer regarding the selection of the compression quality q as far as I am concerned and conducted additional experiments to further demonstrate the usefulness of the approach. I would encourage the authors to include this discussion in the final version of the paper. I would also encourage them to include the additional experiments they conducted with fixed memory size and amount of memory that can be saved.

 The authors propose a self-supervised approach for the task of surround-view depth estimation . 2D image features are un-projected onto a shared 3D volume, which is later queried for decoding depth maps at target views . This should help produce more consistent depth maps across views . The pipeline also enables novel-view depths synthesis . The problem setting may be useful for autonomous driving . The authors have discussed the limitation and potential negative societal impact of their work .
Gold Metareview 109:
Initially, the paper had mixed reviews (455).  The major concerns from the reviews were:

1. missing refs about unprojection. (K314)
2. quality advantage is not convincing, slightly better than FSM, while qualitative results show not obvious improvements. (K314)
3. visualize the depth maps as point clouds (K314)
4. what is the trade-off between resolution/memory, computation, and depth estimation? (K314, ZBww)
5. insufficient experiments (9Ef1)
6. comparison with monocular methods (9Ef1)
7. cubic vs spherical space? (9Ef1)
8. can it be trained on real data w/o GT supervision? (9Ef1)
9. how to handle collision of multiple pixel rays? (ZBww)
10. why use different MLPs to fuse "overlap" and "non-overlap" features? No ablation study on this. (ZBww)

The authors wrote a response to address these concerns, providing more qualitative results and ablation studies, as well as further explanations.  The reviewers were satisfied with the response, and K314 upgraded their rating to 6, while other reviewers maintained 5s. The reviewers appreciated the novel problem and the solution that can produce more consistent depth maps across views, and also synthesize depth maps in novel views. After reading the paper, the AC agrees with the reviewers, noting that the paper  addresses the limitations of the problem setup of previous work [13], thus developing a new line of research.  Thus, the AC recommends accept. The authors should prepare a revised version of the paper according to the reviews, rebuttal, and discussion.

 FlowSelect uses normalizing flows to learn a data distribution and MCMC to sample individual held-out features from their conditional distribution . It then passes these samples through a single model fit on the original data to generate samples from the null distribution . Empirically, FLOW SELECT consistently controls the FDR on both synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks . Their method outperforms several baseline procedures based on knockoffs, etc., and they are able to find SNPs relevant for the oil content in soy beans .
Gold Metareview 111:
This paper describes how to use normalizing flows for selecting features in a way that controls the type-1 error by using a normalizing flow along with MCMC to sample from the null distribution. The majority of the reviewers were positive, however the most confident reviewer was negative. From taking a look at that reviewers concerns, I tend to agree with most of them.

The paper is titled knockoff-free, which means in the context of this paper that both 1) 1-bit p-values are not used and 2) The full knockoff property is not required, only sampling from complete conditionals are required. Most of the experiments compare knockoff methods to the proposed approach, so it's not clear if 1) 1-bit p-values are not great or 2) the model-X process/complete conditional sampling process is better with normalizing flows. The former point is known and the latter point on the best way to sample from the complete conditionals is really the value. 

If we take the paper as, 

1) complete conditionals are 1-D
2) MCMC can be used to sample from a 1-D unnormalized density
3) Simple MCMC won't be bad because the problem is 1-D

-> Any likelihood based deep generative model can be used to sample complete conditionals

then it's a solid paper.

On the other hand, the belief that flows are the correct choice versus other likelihood-based deep generative models is harder to take as there's only a comparison with a mixture density network used in the original HRT paper. Also from other uses of these models, different models are better in different situations. I'd suggest a heavy discussion in the paper on this point at the minimum. Maybe even a reframing of the paper is needed.

Finally, for the test statistic, the HRT may not be the best choice for work like this paper that studies the problems with estimating X-distribution. The  paper "CONTRA: Contrarian statistics for controlled variable selection" at AISTATS 2021 shows that the HRT test statistic is more sensitive to model-X estimation errors than a simple mixture statistic that doesn't give up much power. The choice of test statistic also merits some discussion in step 3.

The only benchmark demonstrated in the paper is Distracting DMControl, which is a set of toy environments with artificial distractions . The authors conjecture that the observation’s the observations’Fourier statistics for the same RL task also vary .
Gold Metareview 112:
The authors have introduced a method of data augmentation for image-based reinforcement learning that performs masking in the frequency domain, combined with techniques for stabilizing Q-learning, to achieve improved performance on a number of DMControl Generalization Benchmark tasks.

There was agreement among the reviewers that this work is novel and technically sound, and their concerns were mainly related to the breadth of tasks explored in the initial submission. During the review process the authors have gone to considerable effort to introduce new tasks (e.g. DrawerWorld, Robosuite and CARLA) and the improved performance of their method appears to generalize well. I believe that this work will be of broad interest to the RL community and recommend it for acceptance.

 This paper proposes TopicGAN, a generative adversarial approach to topic modeling and text generation . The paper is difficult to understand and some of the explanations are not convincing . It adopts the framework of InfoGAN to generates the bag-of-words of a document . The latent codes in InfoGAN correspond to the latent topics in topic modelling . The author draws lessons from the infoGAN and designed a creative object function with reconstruction loss and categorical loss .
Gold Metareview 113:
This paper proposes TopicGAN, a generative adversarial approach to topic modeling and text generation. TopicGAN operates in two steps: it first generates latent topics and produces bag-of-words corresponding to those latent topics. In the second step, the model generates text conditioning on those topic words.

Pros: 
It combines the strength of topic models (interpretable topics that are learned unsupervised) with GAN for text generation.

Cons: 
There are three major concerns raised by reviewers: (1) clarity, (2) relatively thin experimental results, and (3) novelty. Of these, the first two were the main concerns. In particular, R1 and R2 raised concerns about insufficient component-wise evaluation (e.g., text classification from topic models) and insufficient GAN-based baselines. Also, the topic model part of TopicGAN seems somewhat underdeveloped in that the model assumes a single topic per document, which is a relatively strong simplifying assumption compared to most other topic models (R1, R3). The technical novelty is not extremely strong in that the proposed model combines existing components together. But this alone would have not been a deal breaker if the empirical results were rigorous and strong.

Verdict:
Reject. Many technical details require clarification and experiments lack sufficient comparisons against prior art.

Temporal Quantile Adjustment (TQA) is proposed for time-series data with a focus on constructing efficient and valid prediction intervals . TQA adjusts the quantile to query in Conformal Prediction at each time t, accounting for both cross-sectional and longitudinal coverage . Theorem 4.1 proved the coverage probability is lowered bounded by 1 - \alpha + E[\hat{\delta}_{N+1,t]
Gold Metareview 115:
In this paper, the authors propose the temporal quantile adjustments (TQA) that can improve longitudinal coverage and preserve cross-sectional coverage for the prediction interval built for regression on cross-sectional time series data. While previous works focus on either of the coverage guarantees, a major contribution of this paper is to achieve both. The research questions addressed in this paper are of critical importance for practitioners in relevant areas. The paper is well written. The presented approach has solid empirical support and decent theoretical guarantees. Including a simulation study to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach under specific (and controlled) setup will further improve the paper.

This research addresses a clear need, as acknowledged by the reviewers. Also, most reviewers found the method clearly described and the experiments compelling, demonstrating an improvement of the state of the art.

The reviewers asked questions about the baselines, evaluation methods and ablation studies. They also made requests related to clarifying the wording and some of the theory.

Only one of the reviewers responded during the discussion period, and the response came very late in the discussion period. However, I read the authors' response and concluded that they adequately addressed most issues raised by the reviewers.

As the model is in the Transformer space, and transformers have previously been shown to be state of the art on a number of tasks, I do not find it necessary to compare against other 'families' of methods. So I will consider that issue addressed as well.

 In this paper, the problem of learning the optimal threshold policy for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is considered . Using the monotonicity property of threshold policies, the authors establish a simple policy gradient formula . Using that, an off-policy actor-critic algorithm (DeepTOP) is proposed to learn the optimal policy . Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform other algorithms in the literature .

The paper considers a subset of dynamic problems, in which the optimal policy is a threshold-policy. The authors use this attribute to formulate tailored off-policy actor-critic algorithms, for both MDPs and RMABs which are gradient-based, so can utilize neural networks. They empirically compare their method to SOTA methods in three MDP domains and three RMAB parameterizations, the results show that their method, DeepTOP, performs better than the compared methods in all the experiments.

The paper is well written and the claims are correct.  The performance of DeepTOP compared to the other methods is impressive.  All four reviewers were on the positive side for acceptance.

Gold Metareview 125:
Description of paper content:

The authors propose a dynamics model that can generalize to novel environments. The train and test MDPs have the same state and action spaces but different dynamics. Environment specific inference is achieved by estimating latent vectors Z that describe the non-stationary or variable part of the dynamics. These Z-s are inferred from trajectory segments in unlabeled environments. The Z-s are learned contrastively: Z-s from the same trajectory are pulled together, and Z-s from separate trajectories are pushed apart. However, to mitigate the error of distancing Z-s from different trajectories but the same environment, Z-s on trajectories with similar transitions are also pushed together using a soft clustering penalty. These losses are justified based on ideas from Pearl’s causal inference.

Summary of paper discussion:

The reviewers concluded that the contributions are conceptually interesting and “somewhat” novel. The reviewers felt that the empirical performance gains of the method over baselines were demonstrated but not extremely impressive.

Generated Summary 126:
 This paper proposes a different look at why neural networks generalize despite optimizing to zero training error, over-parameterization, etc. The core idea is to define "image functions" which are determined by the training image and the current training iteration . The idea could be potentially interesting, but I found the writing and presentation is a bit confusing . The paper is poorly written, poorly structured and difficult to read . I do not think this is an insightful finding because this is what would be expected by "training" the network .
Gold Metareview 126:
In an attempt to understand generalization, this paper aims at understanding the dynamics of functions presented by the network for different images in the training set. Authors look at activation patterns (whether a ReLU activation is on or off) as a way of characterizing the active paths in the network and approximating the function presented by the network for each image. Authors study different related statics (eg. correlation) and how they evolve during training including.

Pros: 
- Understanding the dynamics of training, how diversity is encouraged by the training procedure and its relationship to generalization is an important problem.
- This paper takes an empirical approach and tries to make interesting empirical observations about the dynamics of the training.

Cons:
- The paper is poorly written in terms of structure, making clear arguments with enough evidence, notation, etc.
- Some empirical trends are shown but their connections to the main claim of the paper about generalization is very weak. The main attempt to connect the observations to generalization is Fig. 7 which shows model accuracy correlated with the ratio of early to mid overlap. This is problematic both because it only has 6 data points and also because a simple correlation analysis is not enough to establish this claim which is more about the cause of generalization.

Reviewers have pointed to various concerns including but not limited to clarity of the paper, lack of rigorous arguments, not providing enough evidence for the arguments, etc. Unfortunately, authors did not participate in the discussion period.

Given the above concerns, I recommend rejecting the paper.

Gold Metareview 127:
I'm quite concerned by the conversation with Anonymous, entitled "Why is the dependence...". My issues concern the empirical Rademacher complexity (ERC) and in particular the choice of the loss class for which the ERC is being computed. This  class is obviously data dependent, but the Reviewers concerns centers on the nature of its data dependence. It is not valid to define the classes by the Jacobian's norm on the input data, as this _structure_ over the space of classes is data dependent, which is not kosher. The reviewer was gently pushing the authors towards a very strong assumption... i'm guessing that the jacobian norm over all data sets was bounded by a particular constant. This seems like a whopping assumption. The fact that I can so easily read this concern off of the reviewer's comments and the authors seem to not be able to understand what the reviewer is getting at, concerns me.

Besides this concern, it seems that this paper has undergone a rather significant revision. I'm not convinced the new version has been properly reviewed. For a theory paper, I'm concerned about letting work through that's not properly vetted, and I'm really not certain this has been. I suggest the authors consider sending it to COLT.

 This works proposes a scalable way of approximating the eigenvectors of the Laplacian in RL by optimizing the graph drawing objective on limited sampled states and pairs of states . The proposed method aims to generalize previous work, which has only been shown in finite state spaces, to continuous and large state spaces . One use-case of the learnt state representation is for reward-shaping that is said to accelerate training of standard goal-driven RL algorithms .
Gold Metareview 129:
This paper provides a novel and non-trivial method for approximating the eigenvectors of the Laplacian, in large or continuous state environments. Eigenvectors of the Laplacian have been used for proto-value functions and eigenoptions, but it has remained an open problem to extend their use to the non-tabular case. This paper makes an important advance towards this goal, and will be of interest to many that would like to learn state representations based on the geometric information given by the Laplacian. 

The paper could be made stronger by including a short discussion on why the limitations of this approach. Its an important new direction, but there must still be open questions (e.g., issues with the approach used to approximate the orthogonality constraint). It will be beneficial to readers to understand these issues.

 A paper introduces “Cross domain schemas” (CDS) for semantic parsing of utterances made to a virtual assistant . CDS captures similarities in requests according to the underlying actions or attributes being discussed . Also introduced is a model which leverages CDS to improve semantic parsing . Results are interesting but the paper has some major limitations . It is unclear to me how CDS (cross-domain schemas) can be generalized to other semantic parsing datasets .
Gold Metareview 130:
Interesting approach aiming to leverage cross domain schemas and generic semantic parsing (based on meaning representation language, MRL) for language understanding. Experiments have been performed on the recently released SNIPS corpus and comparisons have been made with multiple recent multi-task learning approaches. Unfortunately, the proposed approach falls short in comparison to the slot gated attention work by Goo et al.

The motivation and description of the cross domain schemas can be improved in the paper, and for replication of experiments it would be useful to include how the annotations are extended for this purpose.

Experimental results could be extended to the other available corpora mentioned in the paper (ATIS and GEO).

The inner problem is strongly convex and the inner and outer objective are smooth and given by a finite sum . The authors propose 2 methods: SOBA and SABA . SOBA updates $x, z, v, v and uses two-timescales decreasing step-sizes . SABA converges linearly to the solution when on bilevil problems satisfying PL-condition .

 The authors propose an approximate MCMC method for sampling a posterior distribution of weights in a Bayesian neural network . While the idea is intriguing, there are a number of flaws in the presentation, notational inconsistencies, and missing experiments that prohibit acceptance in the current form . The idea of extending Riemannian Langevin dynamics to functional spaces is elegant . However it is extremely hard to follow the proposed method as details are kept to a minimum .
Gold Metareview 132:
This paper addresses a promising and challenging idea in Bayesian deep learning, namely thinking about distributions over functions rather than distributions over parameters.  This is formulated by doing MCMC in a functional space rather than directly in the parameter space.  The reviewers were unfortunately not convinced by the approach citing a variety of technical flaws, a lack of clarity of exposition and critical experiments.  In general, it seems that the motivation of the paper is compelling and the idea promising, but perhaps the paper was hastily written before the ideas were fully developed and comprehensive experiments could be run.  Hopefully the reviewer feedback will be helpful to further develop the work and lead to a future submission.

Note: Unfortunately one review was too short to be informative.  However, fortunately the other two reviews were sufficiently thorough to provide enough signal.

 This paper proposes a novel unsupervised scene decomposition model that infers object shapes, appearances and 3D poses . The benefits over existing models are the structured, 3D object representations which allows to manipulate objects in the scenes such as moving and replacing objects . The paper aims to decompose a scene into objects and infer the representations of 3D occupancy, color, and pose for each object from a single image without supervision . The experiments show the proposed model (1) achieves competitive 2D segmentation performance on CLEVR6, (2) supports object-wise scene manipulation, and (3) outperforms non-object-centric methods on CATER snitch localization .
Gold Metareview 134:
The paper proposes an approach for learning a decomposition of a scene into 3D objects using single images without pose annotations as training data. The model is based on Slot Attention and NeRF. Results are demonstrated on CLEVR and its variants. 

The reviewers point out that the method is reasonable and the paper is quite good, but even after considering the authors' feedback agree that the paper is not ready for acceptance. In particular, the key concern is around experimental evaluation - that it is performed on one dataset (and variants thereof) and that the evaluation of the 3D properties of the model is not sufficiently convincing: it does not outperform 2D object learning methods on segmentation and is not compared to those on "snitch localization".

Overall, this is a reasonable paper, and the results are promising but somewhat inconclusive, so I recommend rejection at this point, but encourage the authors to improve the paper and resubmit to a different venue.

(One remark. The paper makes a point of not using any annotation. It is technically true, but in practice on CLEVR unsupervised segmentation works so well that it's basically as if segmentation masks were provided. If the authors could demonstrate that their method - possibly with provided coarse segmentation masks - works on more complex datasets, it would be a nice additional experiment)

 The submission proposes a method for transfer in reinforcement learning building on estimating a small set of factors describing a system and modelling the agent as a dynamic bayesian network . The method splits into domain shared and domain dependent factors which are modelled via a new form of structured sequential VAE .

Overall I quite liked this paper as it introduces a well-motivated idea that can be useful to the research community .

The authors present a method called "AdaRL" that learns a structured latent representation that characterizes relationships between different variables in an RL system. The method is evaluated on modified Pong and Cart-Pole domains and it is shown to outperform other transfer learning baselines. The reviewers agree that the method makes sense and addresses an important problem of transfer in RL. The authors did a good job in the rebuttal to empirically validate their claims and provided extra experiments. The reviewers also point out that the evaluated domains are rather simple and the paper would benefit from evaluations in a more complex environment as well as better writing. Please focus on improving these aspects in the final version of the paper.

 This paper tries to give theoretical guarantee about the safeness of semi-supervised learning methods . This paper gives a new definition of safe SSL: "a SSL algorithm is safe if it has theoretical guarantees that are similar or stronger to the complete case baseline" The paper has good clarity on the theory presented and has generally sound approaches and good results . Technical results are not particularly complex but flow naturally and results are intuitive . It would be interesting to test your debiasing on a larger task, such as ImageNet .
Gold Metareview 137:
This paper provides an interesting generalized perspective on SSL techniques and proposes a debiasing technique that can be viewed as decreasing the variance of the risk estimate. The authors argue that this leads to estimators that are better than the purely supervised estimator under a rather weak assumption called MCAR - which assumes that the probability of a missing label is independent of covariate and label. 

Although the exposition and perspective are interesting, this paper is borderline for the following two main reasons:

1. A few reviewers were not convinced of the theoretical result that is supposed to show that unlabeled data strictly helps - indeed, whereas usual variance reduction techniques (e.g for optimization schemes such as SGD etc.) lead to a strict gain in terms of convergence rate, there is no clear asymptotic/high probability statement that indicates statistical gain of the corresponding estimator (which is what we really care about - not the risk estimate). The dependence of lambda_opt on theta (which changes every iteration) does not help in providing such a statement. Since this is the primary contribution of the paper, I would suggest the authors follow through with the analysis to show a gain for the actual estimator compared to the "complete case" (only using supervised data). 

On that note, the authors claimed in their rebuttal that they have added an asymptotic variance analysis in Appendix I, which indeed would have made a very valuable point - however, I could only find a copy-pasted version of Theorem 3.1. in Appendix I? Similarly, Appendix F does not seem to include the comparison between debasing using labeled and unlabeled data but instead contains the proof of Theorem 3.2. Perhaps the wrong revision was uploaded, but unfortunately, given the current version, this point is not adequately addressed.

2. If the experimental results were more extensive and conclusive, then the current theorem could have perhaps been alright as a mainly methodological contribution. However, as the authors note, extensive experiments require a lot of compute power - however, given the lack of the ultimate theorem, the methodology becomes the primary contribution and would thus require more experimental evidence as the reviewers asked for.
  
Addressing one of the above points would push the paper above the acceptance threshold which we hope the authors can pursue in their next submission. 

Generated Summary 138:
 The paper is relatively well organised and therefore it is fairly easy to follow . Learning a CEU model from limited preference statements can be difficult in practice . Adopting a sparse representation of the capacity and utility functions involved in the model appears to be novel . The complexity of the learning process is unclear for me - how many comparisons are necessary ? Further developments and experiments are necessary, but if they confirm significance of the approach, the result is valuable .
Gold Metareview 138:
Meta Review: The paper presents a new means to learn sparse Choquet integral, using for instance classical L_1 penalization techniques. This research participates to a long trend of research aiming at learning preference functions in various settings (here, having only limited preferential information). 

All reviewers agree that the paper is well-written and the contribution nicely presented. Two main critics were done by the reviewers:

* The first is the potential significance of the research, i.e., that it addresses an actual real-world problem. After discussion and rebuttals, this critic appears to be of less importance

* The second (with which I would concur) is that the experimental part is limited in different ways. The main critics regarding those are as follows:
1. The authors only use synthetic data that mostly comply with their assumptions, thereby confirming that their approach is valid. THey do not really challenge it.
2. There is no realistic data sets used (which is very difficult to obtain in incremental preference learning, but less in passive preference learning).
3. There is also no real comparisons with other methods intending to learn value functions from observed preferences. Given the large literature on preference learning and the fact that most learning papers require the comparisons with other baselines when possible, one could have hoped to have such comparisons. 

Depsite that, the paper appears to be well-made with a relevant algorithmic contribution.

 The proposed SCL-WC method outperforms state-of-the-art weakly-supervised whole-slide image classification studies . The application of contrastive learning, i.e., MoCov3, in histopathological image classification is very common .

The proposed method consists of two main steps: a domain-specific feature extractor pretrained using a Swin-Transformer .
Gold Metareview 139:
This work presents a method to obtain slide level representations in computational pathology. The specific contributions of this work are a positive-negative-aware module (PNM) and a weakly-supervised cross-slide contrastive learning (WSCL) module and a loss to encourage intra-WSI local patch separation and inter-WSI global feature contrast. The idea is to use the attention weights in a MIL framework as patch level pseudo labels. These are used to compute "weights" for positive and negative patches (the latter of which is assumed to be significantly larger in number for a given WSI). By using these weights in a contrastive manner to push the representations from positive patches away from those of negative patches, the model learns more effectively since it is less susceptible to the noise from the negative patches.

The reviewers found these contributions novel. During the review, the largest source of concern was along the choices made during the empirical evaluation. Specifically, the manuscript in its current form lacked empirical backing for several of the choices made regarding the neural architecture, the algorithm for self-supervised learning etc. In response to this the authors conducted several different kinds of ablation studies (which were incorporated into the supplement) during the rebuttal process, which other reviewers found convincing as a potential explanation of the outcomes.

Overall, I found the main contributions of this work (leveraging patch level attention weights as psuedo labels) to be an interesting use case for computational pathology to better focus the learning signal on positive patches. My additional comment is that I think the additional ablation experiments (and references) are an important part of the contributions of this work and should be incorporated into the main paper rather than in the appendix (several equations can be compressed to make space in the manuscript in addition to the additional page).

This work studies the effect of initialization scaling on the gradient flow training dynamics of three layer (two hidden layer) MLPs. . Extending Luo et al. 2021's analysis, the authors identify "linear", "critical" and "condensed" regime depending on initialization scaling parameters

Strength pointed out by the authors include, "new insight into training dynamics of MLPS with more than one hidden layer", "elegant and insightful analysis" for a "dauntingly difficult problem" and that "phase diagram is neat and valuable contribution"

Reviewer `PDY9` saw major weakness as treating the second layer as linear regime only, which makes the analysis similar to previous work (Luo et al., 2021). In general, the reviewer believes that the full comprehensive analysis on different phases for each layer is lacking. Although the reviewer did not respond to the AC, this issue has been addressed by author response. Also please do follow the recommendation of the reviewers in terms of improving writing (better description of gamma_2, gamma_3 for example), improving related works, as well as making figures more legible. 

Overall, while the paper is somewhat borderline, there are interesting insights and analysis as the reviewers pointed out without critical issues. I recommend accepting this work at NeurIPS 2022.

The paper describes a genetic algorithm for molecular optimization under constraints. The aim is to generate molecules with better properties while close to an initial lead molecule. The proposed approach is a two-stage one. The first stage aims to satisfy constraints and searches for feasible molecules that are similar to the lead. The second stage optimizes the molecular property. The method is evaluated on logP optimization task, with minor improvement over previous work.

The reviewers point out the following strengths and weaknesses:

Strengths:

- Molecular optimization under structural constraints is an important research direction.
- Comprehensive related work section.

Weaknesses:

- Lack of novelty because it is a standard application of genetic algorithm.
- The results show that the proposed method did not outperform existing baselines.
- The main claim of the paper (benefit of two-stage procedure) is not supported by ablation study.
- The authors only conduct experiments on improving LogP, which is a benchmark that is too easy and not challenging.
- The objective function and cross-over operation are the same or very similar to previous work.
- The experimental evaluation is limited, and the overall setting is not very relevant to real-world tasks.

The paper proposes a framework for characterizing harmful text generated from LLMs. This is a timely and extremely important topic, and the paper engages with the complex socio-technical questions around it. The reviewers are split in their opinions (three in favor of acceptance; three opposed). The key argument raised against the paper is that it does not introduce a new benchmark or dataset, and does not make falsifiable claims. The meta-reviewers consider the paper to be well in-scope for the track: despite lacking empirical results, it provides a "framework for responsible dataset development" and clearly identifies "significant problems with existing datasets."

 The experiment results are par (or worse) to the existing NAS algorithms . The authors proposed TE-NAS to rank architectures by analyzing the two indicators . The method can be used to search within 30 minutes (on CIFAR-10) and 4 hours (on ImageNet) The authors made efforts to add interpretability to their method . The metrics for trainability and expressivity seem to be the direct application of deep learning theories (NTK, linear region)
Gold Metareview 152:
The authors propose training-free neural architecture search using two theoretically inspired heuristics: the condition number of the Neural Tangent Kernel (to measure "trainability" of the architecture), and the number of linear regions in the input space (to measure "expressivity"). These two heuristics are negatively and positively correlated with test accuracy, respectively, allowing for fast, training-free Neural Architecture Search. It is certainly not the first training-free NAS proposal, but achieves competitive results with much more expensive NAS methods.

A few reviewers mentioned limited novelty of the method, a claim with which I agree. The contribution of the paper, however, is something different than how it was presented. The core message seems to be that the two proposed heuristics can greatly speed up NAS, and should be a baseline method against which more expensive methods should test.

I feel like this is a borderline paper, but may be of interest to researchers in the field.

 Authors define memorization as any situation in which the model predicts the correct word as maximum probability given its context . They then study memorization paper according to part of speech, suggesting that rare words tend to lead to memorized sequences .

Larger models tend to forget less, and they seem to memorize unique parts of speech tokens . The authors have not discussed the limitations of their work thoroughly .
Gold Metareview 154:
This paper studies the underlying training and memorization dynamics of very large language models. The main take aways are that larger-sized language models memorize training data faster, and that this memorization happens before the overfitting of language modeling. Tokens with certain part-of-speech tags (nouns, numerals) seem to be memorized faster during training. 

Overall, most reviewers feel positively about this paper, agreeing that it tackles an important problem and that it provides a solid contribution. The experimental results are detailed and use reasonable metrics for data memorization, including the forgetting identifier experiments. Some of the weaknesses that have been pointed out (e.g. regarding the significance of the part-of-speech tags experiment, clarifying the criteria for memorization, etc.) seem to have been well addressed during the author response. Therefore, I recommend acceptance.

 Authors show certain complete neural network verifiers can be mislead by carefully crafted neural networks that exploit round-off errors . Such a construction can be obfuscated by taking advantage of the compounding effect when there are many layers of the network . Authors propose to construct “adversarial neural networks” that can cause the complete verifier to produce imprecise results in floating point arithmetics . They also showed it is possible to insert a backdoor to the network such that the backdoor is missed by the verifier .
Gold Metareview 156:
The authors demonstrate that complete neural network verification methods that use limited precision arithmetic can fail to detect the possibility of attacks that exploit numerical roundoff errors. They develop techniques to insert a backdoor into networks enabling such exploitation, that remains undetected by neural network verifiers and a simple defence against this particular backdoor insertion. 

The paper demonstrates an important and often ignored shortcoming of neural network verification methods, getting around which remains a significant challenge. Particularly in adversarial situations, this is a significant risk and needs to be studied carefully in further work.

All reviewers were in agreement on acceptance and concerns raised were adequately addressed in the rebuttal phase, hence I recommend acceptance. However, a few clarifications raised by the official reviewers and public comments should be addressed in the final revision:
1) Acknowledging that incomplete verification methods that rely on sound overapproximation do not suffer from this shortcoming.
2) Concerns around reproducibility of MIPVerify related experiments brought up in public comments.

The latent space is decomposed into a content space and a motion space, and the main contribution is the proposal to model the motion space using Hamiltonian dynamics. All reviewers agree that the idea of using Hamiltonian dynamics is interesting and novel. One main critique, that the authors agreed on, was that the operator does not contain any stochasticity and that this might be a limitation when applying the idea to model more complex data. Another remark was that the experiments are limited and experiments on less constraint data are missing. A quick look at the baseline methods revealed that they also use the same kind of data sets to evaluate their methods, so this latter concern might be of minor importance. 
All in all, the potential positive outcomes of this paper outweight its current limitations, so we recommend acceptance at this point, while urging authors to address the remaining concerns in the final version.

 Authors propose a diffusion model that adds a mask as an additional inputs to noisy data . The mask controls which positions in the input should be denoised, in order to provide control for partial inference with controllable positions . This method also offers the opportunity for subtle control at inference time, which could be useful for downstream human-in-the-loop applications . This idea is very close to SUNDAE proposed by DeepMind this year, which is claimed on page 6 .
Gold Metareview 158:
This paper introduces SUNMASK for modeling discrete sequences. It builds upon previous works such as SUNDAE, Coconet and order-agnostic NADE, but uses a masking scheme that enables fine-grained or human-in-the-loop control during the generation. The qualitative experiments about musical inpainting and masking terms in language modeling do support this motivation to some extent. However, the reviewers are mainly concerned with both the algorithmic novelty and experiments of the paper.
 
Regarding the algorithmic novelty, some reviewers are concerned that the method is a straightforward combination of SUNMASK and Coconet. I tend to agree with this. Also the reviewers are concerned that the paper could have done a better job in the introduction and background section by putting the method in a better context and better describing related methods such as SUNDAE. This could help highlight the novelty of the paper.
 
Regarding the experiments, some reviewers are concerned about language modeling (Fig. 2) experiments, and that they do not show much improvement over SUNDAE. I tend to agree, and this is also shown in the results of Table 3 where it is clear that the quality of the language model is not on a par with the recent developments.
 
Also some of the motivations of the paper, especially the arguments about "high trust / low trust" interpretation of the mask, was unclear to me.
 
In short, I believe the paper should be clarified and improved by addressing the above concerns.

The resulting system is evaluated on several different tasks using synthetic data . In general, the paper is easy to follow, the evaluation proves some potential of the proposed method . However, there are some critical concerns of the paper listed below .

This paper proposed a long-term object-based memory system for robots.  The proposed method builds on existing ideas of data association filters and neural-net attention mechanisms to learn transition and observation models of objects from labelled trajectories.  The proposed method was compared with baseline algorithms in a set of experiments.

The initial reviews raised multiple concerns about the paper. Reviewers nrGQ and  V7qP commented on the conceptual gap between the problem proposed in the introduction and the extent of the experiments. Reviewer qPet understood the paper to be a form of object re-identification and was concerned about the limited comparisons with related work.  The author response clarified their goal of estimating the states of the objects in the world, which they state is different from the goals of long-term tracking and object reidentification mentioned by the reviewers.  The authors also clarified the relationship to other work in slot-attention and data association filters.  

The ensuing discussion among the reviewers indicated that the paper's contribution remained unclear even after the author response. Two reviewers noted the paper did not clearly communicate the problem being solved (all reviewers had a different view of the problem in the paper).  These reviewers wanted a better motivation for the problem being addressed in this paper.  The third reviewer remained unconvinced that the problem in the paper was different from long-term object tracking.

Three knowledgeable reviewers indicate reject as the contributions of the paper were unclear to all of them. The paper is therefore rejected.

Meta Review: This paper proposes LIGER to better use the foundation model in a weakly-supervised setting. LIEGER has two key components: 1) a finer estimator of weak source quality by dividing the embedding space and learning the source accuracy for each part, 2) source voting expansion  in the embedding space.

The reviewers agree that the proposed work is innovative and makes a significant technical contribution in using pretrained models under weak supervision. There were some concerns raised by reviewers, but most of them have been well addressed by the authors.  I recommend acceptance of this paper given its novelty and significant technical contribution.

 The paper tackles a typically disregarded problem in contrastive learning: hard negative mining . Authors proved that their new objective is a more biased lower bound than InfoNCE, but with less variance . The authors response partially addressed my concerns and I would raise the rating to 6 . This paper adopts semi-hard negative mining, a sampling strategy widely used for metric learning, for contrastive self-supervised learning . It chooses the negative samples in the range of $[w_l, w_u]$ percentiles in terms of normalized feature distance .
Gold Metareview 161:
This paper addresses the problem of how best to sample hard negatives during contrastive learning, a topic of importance for the recently resurgent field of metric learning / contrastive loss-based unsupervised representation learning. Backed by theoretical results for a new low-variance version of the NCE, the paper proposes an easy-to-implement "Ring" method for selecting negatives that are at just the right level of difficulty, neither too hard nor too easy.

Happily, this is a paper that has improved significantly through the interactive peer review of a dedicated set of reviewers combined with prompt responses from the authors. Perhaps the result that tipped this paper over the line in my assessment: the new experimental results now show significant gains from applying the "Ring" approach for hard negative sampling to near-state-of-the-art implementations of the MoCo-v2 approach, which is among the leading unsupervised visual feature learning approaches.

 ODConv combines two prior ideas, i.e. filter recalibration with attention in SENet and additive kernels in CondConv/DyConv, and also generalizes to all remaining dimensions of convolutional filters . The method is overall quite efficient without too much overhead, due to separate attention weights for different dimensions . The proposed method can be plugged into most existing CNN architectures and has good performance on various public datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO .

This paper presents ODConv, a convolution pattern which uses attention in the convolutions across all dimensions of the weight tensor.
The paper is well motivated and well explained, easy to follow.
This work is built on top of previous work, but reviewers all agree that the contributions of this paper are significant.
The experimental section is comprehensive, with several benchmarks, and show clear improvements.
The reviewers suggested a few additional remarks, and discussions to add to the paper, which the authors have addressed in the rebuttal. Reviewers seem in general happy with the authors answers to their concerns.
This seems like a sound and meaningful paper. I am fully in favour of acceptance, and I recommend this paper to be presented as a spotlight.

The review ratings/confidences were 5/2, 6/2, 4/4, and 5/2. Although the average rating of 5 was just above the acceptance threshold, I think that it should somehow be discounted by the lower confidence levels. Although I myself does not have expertise in the field of BCI, as for the reviewers' evaluation, I think that they basically agreed on the following points:
- The problem is well motivated.
- The proposed method was built on DyEnsemble with some empirically-motivated extensions to have decoder models dynamically evolving. One could then argue that the proposal is not groundbreaking but somehow incremental.
- The authors showed experimentally that the proposed method works well compared with a number of other existing methods.

I also noticed that the authors made revision (adding a paragraph at the end of Section 2: It can be observed in the August 10 revision), which would have improved readability of this paper. I would thus recommend acceptance of this paper, provided that there is room for it.

It tries to recast the problem of training neural networks as a control problem . Supervised learning is reformulated as a non-linear control problem with a Lyapunov based loss .

Gold Metareview 164:
This paper aims to study the convergence of deep neural networks training via a control theoretic analysis. This is a very interesting approach to establish theoretical understanding of deep learning. However, there are several concerns raised by the reviewers:

1.	The contribution of this paper is limited. The results simply follow from standard optimal control. It is not clear what new insight the paper provides.
2.	There are already quite a few works on control theoretic analysis of deep learning. This paper did not do a good job on presenting its novelty and difference with existing works.
3.	The experimental part is weak. It only involves small data set and very simple networks.

Based on these, I am not able to recommend acceptance for the current manuscript. But the authors are encouraged to continue this research.

 The paper provides a solution for multi-cloud configuration problem . It tries to provide cloud customers with an optimal configuration to minimise runtime and cost . The authors have done a commendable job in a very relevant research area which will become more prominent in the coming years . Main novelty of the paper lies in creating the dataset for the above problem . Such dataset can be immensely useful for academic research as "executing code" in cloud can be prohibitively expensive .
Gold Metareview 165:
This paper studies the problem of choosing the best cloud provider for a task. The problem is formulated as a bandit and solved using algorithm CloudBandit. The algorithm is compared to several baselines, such as SMAC, and performs well. The evaluation is done on 60 different multi-cloud configuration tasks across 3 public cloud providers, which the authors want to share with the public.

This paper has four borderline reject reviews. All reviewers agree that it studies an important problem and that the promised multi-cloud optimization dataset could spark more research in the area of cloud optimization. The weaknesses of the paper are that it is not technically strong and that the quality of the new dataset is not clear from its description. At the end, the scores of this paper are not good enough for acceptance. Therefore, it is rejected.

 A paper proposes a new dataset that has 1M higher-resolution simulated images along with 1K annotated real-world images of the same setup . Its results suggest that disentangled representations can result in better out of distribution task performances . The authors proposed a unique learning scheme for representation disentanglement . Unlike infoGAN or ACGAN which learn disjoint feature representations for describing the attributes of interest (via unsupervised and supervised settings), the authors chose to address this task in a questionable "weakly supervised setting"
Gold Metareview 166:
This paper introduces a new dataset for evaluating disentanglement and its impact on out of distribution generalization based on the trifinger robotics platform. Using this dataset, the authors rigorously investigate the performance of beta-VAEs in this setting under a number of conditions, finding that weak supervision is necessary to induce disentangled representations, and that, perhaps surprisingly, disentanglement does not help for sim2real settings despite the similarity between the simulator and the real data. Reviewers were divided on the work, but had a number of concerns related to the claims of novel architecture, comparisons to baselines, and issues with the clarity of the paper, some of which were addressed in the authors' response. I agree with some of these concerns, particularly with respect to the claims of novel architectures since the modifications could simply be viewed as tweaking hyperparameters and are not rigorously compared to baselines. However, I think the novelty of the dataset and the rigorous evaluation of OOD generalization settings is likely to be valuable enough to the community to merit acceptance. I'd encourage the authors, however, to tone down some of the claims regarding the architecture (or provide sufficient baseline comparisons), and instead focus on the dataset and the OOD results. I recommend acceptance.

 A new dataset for multimodal visuo-tactile learning called Touch and Go is proposed, in which human data collectors probe objects in natural environments with tactile sensors . The data are collected by human in an “approximately egocentric” manner, which is thought to have higher diversity than those collected by robots . The functionality of the dataset remains undetermined . The motivation of the proposed tactile-driven image stylization is not clearly stated, and the qualitative results seem trivial .
Gold Metareview 167:
Overall, all reviewers see the novelty in the dataset that provides an original new set of tactile data, accounting for a wide range of objects and scene, collected in the wild. The paper is overall well written, clear and easy to follow, and provides a good demonstration of the importance and usefulness of the dataset, going beyond datasets collected by robots in the context of material properties. It also includes initial steps towards benchmarking, although it is not the core contribution of the paper, which lies in the creation of the dataset itself. 

Two reviewers recommend acceptance, two stand marginally below acceptance, and one does recommend rejection. The authors have provided detailed responses to all reviewers’ comments and concerns and updated their manuscript. The main concerns of those reviewers sitting on the fence seem to be answered and limitations acknowledged however the element of bias in the data collection was still considered as a possible concern. Based on my reading and accounting for the authors changes, there approach itself is novel and original and hence provides already a relevant contribution to NeuroIPS; while the authors acknowledge limitations and future work avenues. The one reviewer recommending rejection didn’t engage in the discussion but from my reading of both the paper, the comments, and the authors responses, I believe the main points were addressed by the authors and misunderstandings clarified. Overall, I believe the papers offers a novel, non-existing dataset that can inspire interesting future works; all the dataset is shared and presented clearly for others to use.

 This paper proposes a continuous-time model for discrete state diffusion models . The results are favourable compared to previous models that used step-wise perturbations . Strengths: This paper develops a continuous time framework for discrete data . Weakness: Relationship to prior works can be discussed more . Using tau-leaping to reduce the NFEs needed for generation is clever . The method performs very well when many corrector steps are used .
Gold Metareview 169:
The work proposes a continuous-time generalization of diffusion models on a discrete space. The description uses continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), in parallel to the existing stochastic differential equation description for continuous space. Reverse CTMC and modeling and ELBO objective are described. Some practical considerations and inspirations are also discussed, including avoiding exponentially large model in high dimensions, efficient reverse (generation) process simulation, and a corrector technique that further exploit the model to improve simulation (generation) quality. An error bound on the learned data distribution is also presented that shows a mild dependency on data dimensionality.

All the reviewers agree that this work presents the very right way to describe the continuous-time version of diffusion model on discrete space, and thereafter inspired techniques make a desired contribution to the community. Some concerns are raised, including still inferior performance than the continuous counterpart, and on the independence among dimensions. The authors provide reasonable remarks on them. Hence, I recommend accept to this paper.

One minor point: In Sec. 4.2, it would be clearer if the independence is specified both among the random variables $x^{1:D}$ in “output” and between each $x^d$ in “output” and $x^{1:D\backslash d}$ in “input”. Conventionally independence refers to the former, in which case the size is only reduced to $S^D \times D S^2$.

 The paper proposes an optimization-based algorithm for bit-flipping a limited number of bits in a quantized / binarized deep-learning model . Adversarial weight attack is an interesting research direction with important practical importance and deserve more studies . The proposed method is mathematically sound . It empirically outperforms or at least is comparable with previous state-of-the-art methods on undefended models . The paper in its current form does not state "why" the number of flipped bits seems to matter .
Gold Metareview 170:
The major concerns about this paper are that (1) There are too many hyper-parameters, such as those needed for ADMM. I'd point out that there are adaptive variants of ADMM and heuristics methods for choosing optimization hyper-parameters, although it would be nice if the authors addressed these issues in the paper.  (2) Some reviewers are concerned that, compared to other related attacks, it’s unclear why flipping fewer bits is an important objective - an attacker might only care about poisoning performance and clean data performance.  The authors respond that flipping fewer bits makes the attack more effective when bits are manipulated by a physical method such as manipulating memory.  Despite these criticisms, reviewers agree that the paper is a well thought-out approach that improves the state of the art by some metrics.


Generated Summary 171:
 The goal of this paper is to evaluate methods for detecting out-of-distribution samples in a more comprehensive fashion than prior work . The paper distinguishes between three different cases of OOD samples: detecting irrelevant inputs, detecting novel classes, detecting domain shift and detecting non-semantic shifts . Hendrycks et al. (2019) used a pre-trained network to improve OOD detection . The results show that cosine similarity consistently outperforms other methods across all sub-tasks .
Gold Metareview 171:
This paper proposes an OOD evaluation framework under three categories: irrelevant input detection, novel class detection, and domain shift detection. As with several reviewers, the AC recognizes the importance and effort to distinguish between different cases of OOD detection, as well as the amount of experimental comparison across several prominent methods in literature (MSP, MC-dropout, cosine similarity, ODIN, Mahalanobis).  

Despite being well-motivated, three knowledgeable reviewers find the paper not ready yet for publication at ICLR. The AC recommends a rejection, given the standing major concerns from the reviewers. The AC is hopeful that the paper can be significantly improved by 

- sufficiently discussing and highlighting the novel insights of the results. 
- a more rigorous definition of  "novel" vs. "irrelevant" inputs. There seem to be overlapping definitions between what Hsu et al. considered vs. this paper. In particular,  Hsu et al distinguish i) samples of a novel class but in a known domain, called semantic shift (S), and ii) samples of known class in a novel domain, called non-semantic shift (NS), both of which are reconsidered in this paper. Therefore, the novelty of this submission is more precisely to distinguish within the category of semantic shift. The AC agrees that this might deem some more rigorous measurement and definition of "semantic closeness". 
- The AC also finds the evaluation of domain shift in Section 3.3.2 may be potentially misleading the community, as it falls out of the standard OOD scope. The notion of common corruption is closer to the robustness problem (which is how ML model predictions changes w.r.t some delta changes in the input space). The changes may not be substantial enough to be "out-of-distribution".

Unlike traditional PC, this generalized PC is effective in training highly complex neural architectures such as transformer networks . The paper is well written with impressive results, although some notation and exposition can be improved . It is comparable to backpropagation in the classification of MNSIT and CIFAR-10 datasets and in training a VAE on MNIST data . Pros: Strong motivation, a very good mathematical foundation; sound mathematical proofs of on the equivalence with BP; potential for strong impact on the community .
Gold Metareview 175:
Motivated by advancing the applicability of backpropagation alternatives, the paper extends predictive coding to non-Gaussian distributions, so it can be used to train effectively complex architectures such as transformers.

The reviews are divided: three reviews give a score of 7 (accept) whereas one review gives a score of 4 (borderline reject). The positive reviews cite the following strengths: clearly stated motivation, technical soundness, potential for impact and convincing experiments. The negative review cites lack of clarity as the main weakness (something also mentioned in one of the positive reviews), while the reviewer is not convinced about the originality of the method given similar advances in variational inference and generative modelling.

On balance, given the potential of impact in the field of predictive coding and the technical soundness, I'm happy to recommend acceptance, even though clarity is somewhat lacking.

Some reviewers requested more details on computational complexity, memory consumption and scalability. I encourage the authors to use the extra content page in the camera-ready version to discuss these aspects further.

 A paper aims to improve the performance of the Nondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN) using unnormalized positive weights instead of probabilities for stack actions and allowing the model to directly observe the state . The gains are not large, but meaningful improvements are observed in the synthetic data set . The model is not space efficient in that the stack is unbound, and thus, consumes large memory . The work is marginally above the acceptance threshold . The ideas are technically sound and empirically proved, but I have several concerns .
Gold Metareview 177:
This paper advances the long running thread of sequence modelling research focussed on differentiable instantiations of stack based models. In particular it builds upon recent work on the Nondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN) by introducing three extensions. The first is to relax the need for a normalised distribution over the state and action distribution and allow unnormalised weights, this mostly serves to facilitate gradient flow and thus easier training. The second extension allows the RNN to condition on the top stack state as well as the symbol, improving expressiveness. The third improvement introduces a method for limiting the memory required to run the proposed model on long sequences, thus allowing its application to practical language modelling tasks. Each of these requires substantial algorithmic innovations.

The reviewers all agree that this is a strong paper worthy of publication. The paper includes a useful review of previous differentiable stack models which nicely sets up the rest of the paper where the contributions are well motivated and clearly presented. The reviewers had a number of clarification questions, partly due to the author's use of overly concise citations for key algorithms rather than inline descriptions. This situation has been improved by updates made to the paper.
The evaluation includes a series of synthetic experiments which are clear and provide a good elucidation of the various stack models properties. The practical evaluation on language modelling is more limited and serves mostly to demonstrate that the nondeterministic model can be scaled to a basic language modelling task.

Overall this is a strong paper with a well motivated and clear hypothesis. It provides a substantial extension to the prior work on nondeterministic stack models and progresses this line of research toward practical applications.

Reviewers were mixed about this paper. The stand-out concern is clearly the fact that this paper does very little to set itself in context. I would echo these concerns, and this is clearly the single greatest weakness of the paper. For example I would highlight lines 54--62, in which the proposed technique is compared only against some nebulously-defined "other".

Despite these concerns, I am inclined to agree with reviewer QEo4 that the paper is acceptable for a workshop, and would strongly encourage the authors to address the concerns raised by reviewers.

In addition to the review comments, a few comments of my own:

- Equation (2) assumes that the SDE is solved via the Euler--Maruyama method. Whilst analytically convenient, I believe it is more elegant to treat the general case for as long as possible (without reducing to just the EM method at this early stage). If the noise has particular structure then it may become desirable to solve the SDE via some more efficient numerical method, e.g. Milstein if using commutative noise or Heun if using additive noise (Heun converges to the Stratonovich solution, but for additive noise then Itô and Stratonovich are identical).
- I think equation (2) may be missing a $t_{n+1}-t_n$ coefficient for the $f$ term.
- The "not too far" of line 67 is usually referred to as a "trust region".

 The paper discusses linear interpolations in the latent space . The key idea is to derive a natural interpolant from the prior distribution p(z), where z is the latent variable . The idea is that the interpolation function you apply to a variable z should not change the distribution of the start and end points of the . interpolation curve are identically distribution . The authors present some set of experiments, where DCGAN generator is trained on the CelebA dataset with the Cauchy prior .
Gold Metareview 180:
All the reviewers and AC agrees that the main strength of the paper that it studies a rather important question of the validity of using linear interpolation in evaluating GANs. The paper gives concrete examples and theoretical and empirical analysis that shows linear interpolation is not a great idea. The potential weakness is that the paper doesn't provide a very convincing new evaluation to replace the linear interpolation. However, given that it's largely unclear what are the right evaluations for GANs, the AC thinks the "negative result" about linear interpolation already deserves an ICLR paper.

 Authors hope to explore a more efficient/reasonable masking strategy for training masked autoencoders (MAEs) Semantic-Guided Masking is based on their intuition that current masking strategies (e.g., random masking) cannot utilize semantic information contained in images . An iBOT-pretrained ViT is used to extract features, and then StyleGAN-based decoder is trained to learn semantic parts . Finally, the learned semantic parts attention maps are used to guide the mask modeling .
Gold Metareview 181:
Authors present a method attempting to perform Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) using semantic knowledge, to try to better approximate the semantic MAE seen in language domain. To do this, they leverage an iBOT framework and add some embeddings of the class token to create "part tokens", which are then compared to patch tokens from iBOT to produce attention maps. The objective for this process is a StyleGAN-based image reconstruction.

Once the part attention maps training is done, the network is then used to guide semantic based part masking based on the generated attention maps, for semantic MAE.  

SemMAE pretrained networks are then compared against other forms of SSL pretraining on ImageNet 1k, iNa, CUB, Cars, and ADE-20K, demonstrating improvements in all domains.

Pros:
- [R] Idea is interesting / novel
- [R] Well written
- [AC/R] Results improve over baselines	
	

Cons:
- [AC/R] Pipeline is complicated.
- [R] What about starting from random MAE and then adapting based on parts knowledge? Authors respond that this is future work.
- [AC/R] Not convinced parts are visual analog of words. Authors provide benchmark improvements in performance, and qualitative visualization of the parts. However, there is no quantitative assessment of the parts and whether they have true semantic meaning.
- [AC/R] Some improvements are marginal. Authors respond that although marginal in some cases, they are consistent. 
- [R] Paper does not discuss more how to deal with background. Authors respond that this is future work.

Overall, all reviewers have changed their assessments to accept, including the one reject reviewer. AC recommends accept, though would be preferable if quantitative assessment of the quality of the semantic parts (for example, by segmentation masks) could be provided.

The proposal is based on the explicit modeling of a unique and shared task causal effect (which the zone generalization metric aims to capture)

The authors develop two metrics for evaluating how different brain zones may be affected by the same stimuli. The framework created shows promising results when applied to actual and simulated data. This is a well-written paper with a particular application in mind. It designs a framework for discussing causal effects for applications in neuroscience. This paper's developed metrics and framework are potentially impactful and present a promising start for future research in this direction. The reviewers and I found the author's replies and rebuttal especially helpful in reaching our decision, so I hope some of these comments and arguments are included in the final version of the paper.

Minor comment: In addition to the comments made by the reviewers below, I would encourage the authors to make the references more consistent. At the moment some authors' first names are included and others are not.

Generated Summary 183:
 The authors propose a new GAN procedure . They exploit the celebrated Benamou-Brenier formulation of the W2 distance between probability measures . Using exactly that natural gradient would involve solving an optimal transport problem (compute the optimal displacement field) and inverting the corresponding operator . The proximal operator is added to training the generator, unlike most other regularizations that focus on the discriminator . I encourage more simulation studies and take more GAN structures into consideration .

 A paper proposed a method, called REM, that generates makes a dataset "unlearnable" to adversarial training . This paper is well-written and the experiments are extensive . However, the proposed REM has the following issues: Unrealistic assumptions and time complexity . The paper proposes a min-min-max formulation to generate robust unlearnable examples . It shows the generated noise can effectively reduce the quality of the trained model through extensive empirical study .
Gold Metareview 184:
To address the problem of unauthorized use of data, methods are proposed to make data unlearnable for deep learning models by adding a type of error-minimizing noise. Based on th fact that the conferred unlearnability is found fragile to adversarial training, the authors design new methods to generate robust unlearnable examples that are protected from adversarial training. In addition, considering the vulnerability of error-minimizing noise in adversarial training, robust error-minimizing noise is then introduced to reduce the adversarial training loss.
The authors have tried to respond to reviewers' comments along with adding more experiments.
Overall, this manuscript finally gets three positive reviews and one negative review, where the possible vulnerability or robustness of error-minimizing noise against (simple) image processing operations was not verified.
In comparison with other manuscripts I'm handling that got consistent positive comments, this manuscript is still recommended to be accepted (poster) with a further study of robustness under simple image transformations in the final version.

Gold Metareview 186:
The reviewers carefully analyzed this work and agreed that the topics investigated in this paper are important and relevant to the field. Overall, the reviewers had a generally positive impression of this paper. One reviewer argued that this paper addresses a relevant and valuable question and makes an important step towards a better understanding of regret when reward shaping is used. Even though this paper makes assumptions that were of some concern to other reviewers, this reviewer argued that the paper is nonetheless an important milestone for the community. Another reviewer acknowledged that this paper conducted a formal theoretical investigation of the impact of reward shaping methods on the sample complexity of RL algorithms and argued that all proofs seem to be sound. This reviewer had a few technical questions, which were all addressed by the authors. Post-rebuttal, the reviewer encouraged the authors to incorporate the corresponding details (such as those discussed in the rebuttal) in the updated version of their draft. A third reviewer emphasized that this paper shed light on reward shaping from a theoretical perspective. They argued that the quality and scientific soundness of the paper are objectively excellent, that the paper is original, and that it deserves merit. The reviewer pointed out one main weakness, however, regarding the assumption of the type of the shaped reward function. They wondered whether this assumption could limit the impact and applicability of the paper's results. After reading the authors' thorough rebuttal, however, the reviewer stated that they were satisfied with all responses and updated their score accordingly. Finally, a fourth reviewer also had an overall positive view of this work but pointed out, as a weakness, the seemingly strong assumption that the shaping signal is an approximation of the optimal value function. After reading the authors' response, however, the reviewer stated that the assumptions made in this paper were not as restrictive as they initially thought, and updated their score. Overall, thus, it seems like most reviewers were positively impressed with the quality of this work. They look forward to an updated paper version addressing the suggestions mentioned in their reviews and during the discussion phase.

 Pacoco uses conditional sampling queries (COND and DUAL) to test closeness of distributions . The algorithm has nearly linear sampling complexity in $n . The experiments show for artificially obtained product distributions and many real-world benchmarks that the asymptotic running time outweighs the constants in the running time . The model, experiments, and empirical comparisons are all in the model of Chakraborty-Meel (AAAI19,NeurIPS20)
Gold Metareview 187:
This submission studies (a somewhat non-standard version of) tolerant closeness testing of distributions over the n-dimensional hypercube. Instead of only iid samples, it is assumed that the tester is able to efficiently evaluate the probability mass at any point in the domain and to sample from the distribution conditioned on any subset of size two of the domain. The main result is
an algorithm with query complexity scaling near-linearly in the dimension. Using only iid samples, one would need exponential dependence on dimension. The algorithm is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets. It is experimentally shown that their algorithm outperforms a previous baseline, which in the worst case has complexity scaling exponentially in the dimension. Overall, this is an interesting work that appears to meet the bar for acceptance.

The proposed method attempts to directly process INRs by utilizing high-order differential operators . The paper is well organized and easy to be understood .
Gold Metareview 188:
The paper proposes a framework to perform signal processing tasks on a signal represented with an implicit neural representation directly in the representation space, without the need to instantiate the signal. 

After the rebuttal period, all reviewers recommend acceptance. 

In particular reviewer 1Yx6, an expert on the topic, finds the idea original, and the quality and clarity of the paper to be high. The reviewer finds that while for now the significance is limited (since working as proposed in the representation space is computationally prophibitavely expensive), this is not a major issue, since the the paper is likely to inspire work that will push the idea further. 
Reviesers edqT and qGk1 also liked the general idea of the paper and find the proposed method to directly perform operations on the representation space of implicit neural representations to be novel and interesting

Reviewer Uh51 initially identified a few issues regarding experimental design, the validation, and on the included literature. The main concern regarding the experimental design of the reviewer was that the paper focuses on images (and not signal processing tasks more broadly), which I don't consider a shortcoming, due to the importance of image processing tasks. The concerns on the validation issues have been addressed as well, and the reviewer raised their score. 

I recommend acceptance of the paper.

 This paper proposes a novel VIO method which estimates 5 DoF poes (with the elevation fixed) from monocular camera and IMU . Main strength of the paper is the nice balance between end-to-end learning and interoperability . Main weakness of the approach is, in my opinion, the evaluation setup and results . The proposed method achieves competitive results on real-world KITTI dataset for odometry, CARLA and AeroGround datasets for map-based localization .
Gold Metareview 189:
The paper proposes a differentiable approach for monocular VIO estimation based on BEV, without relying on deep neural networks. The reviewers find the paper well written and the idea of using BEV to be interesting. This paper received highly mixed reviews. The major concerns raised by the reviewers include empirical evaluations of the model interpretability, justification for relying on algorithmic priors than parameters, results on more challenging datasets, positioning this work with respect to existing work on deep state estimators, and clarifications regarding the claims made, among others. Most of the concerns raised by the reviewers have been thoroughly addressed in the rebuttal. I thank the authors for the engaging discussions during the rebuttal. Some minor concerns still exist. Nevertheless, I agree with the reviewers that the paper is an interesting contribution.

Generated Summary 190:
 The main contribution of this paper is that it shows both theoretically and empirically that in linear graph embeddings, the generalization error is bounded by the norms of the embedding vectors . In practice, the positive training pairs are not restricted to 1-hop neighbors, but could also be 2 or more hops . Overall, this work is theoretically complete and experimentally sufficient . Authors argue that it is the norm of the coordinates that determines the success of the learnt representation .
Gold Metareview 190:
This paper provides a generalization analysis for graph embedding methods concluding with the observation that the norm of the embedding vectors provides an effective regularization, more so than dimensionality alone. The main theoretical result is backed up by several experiments.  While the result appears to be correct, norm control, dimensionality reduction and early stopping during optimization are all very well studied in machine learning as effective regularizers, either operating alone or in conjunction. The regularization parameters, iteration count, embedding dimensionality is typically tuned for an application. The AC agrees with Reviewer 2 that the paper does not provide sufficiently interesting insights beyond this observation and is unlikely to influence practical applications of these methods.   Both reviewer 2 and 3 have also raised points on the need for stronger empirical analysis.

This paper studies inverse reinforcement learning through the prism of regularized Markov decision processes, by generalizing MaxEntIRL from the negative entropy to any strongly convex regularizer (as a side note, strict convexity might be enough for many results).

The paper considers the stochastic proximal point algorithm, the main contribution is a convergence proof (in addition to arguing that it is a practical algorithm for ERM problems).  However, reviewer EvJ6 and xJB8 pointed out a fatal flaw in Lemma 1 that affects all the downstream results, and the other two reviewers and myself agree that this invalidates the core results. Reviewer EvJ6 gives extensive examples of how the lemma cannot be simply fixed. So while this is an interesting stochastic extension of the famous deterministic method and may warrant further study, this paper doesn't yet provide a rigorous convergence proof.

 This paper puts forth a methodology for supervised spectral clustering . It could spark further research in this direction, by building on strong theoretical foundations . The main weaknesses of the paper are: (1) a lack of direction and (2) an insufficient distinction from previous works . The geometrical insights are didactical and well communicated . While I like the general idea and I appreciated the effort in explaining the underlying theory, I think there is no significant methodological novelty .
Gold Metareview 194:
There was some discussion on this paper, both with the authors and between reviewers. On the one hand, there is a general agreement that the empirical results suggesting that spectral clustering-based method can be competitive with SOTA methods on node classification benchmark is an interesting result. One the other hand, reviewers did not find a significantly novel contribution in the methodology proposed, and found that the empirical evaluation lacks depth and details to be really informative (eg, to understand why some methods work or not on some benchmarks). There is therefore a consensus that the paper is not ready for ICLR in its current form, but we hope that the reviews and discussion will help the authors prepare a revised version in the future.

This paper proposes a self-exciting temporal point process model with a non-stationary triggering kernel to model complex dependencies in temporal and spatio-temporal event data. The kernel is represented by its finite rank decomposition and a set of neural basis functions (feature functions). The proposed model has superior performance in comparison to other state-of-the-arts methods. All the reviewers recognized that the model is interesting and advances the state of the art in a meaningful way. While they were some concerns regarding the experimental evaluation, particularly in terms of real data, and the presentation, the rebuttal/revision by the authors cleared up these concerns.

 An SDE grad flow is proposed for solving the Wasserstein normalization . The motivation of normalizing the uncertain measures into the 2-Wasserstein ball of certain measure is unclear to me . The clarity of the manuscript is not quite good (in my opinion). The paper aims to give a better way of handling the noisy label data, by providing a way to better utilize the information given by high-loss samples, which are often simply filtered out in previous works .
Gold Metareview 196:
This paper proposes a potentially very interesting and original approach to handle label noise.  The numerical experiments suggest that the method works very well. But the paper  itself has been deemed very hard and demanding to read and understand for a general machine learning crowd and even by experts in the fields of optimal transport and  Markov theory. 

Note that due to the low confidence in several review an additional emergency review by an expert was asked and it confirmed the global opinion from  other reviewers that the paper is interesting but needs a major rewriting before acceptance in a ML conference. The AC strongly suggest that the authors work on a more pedagogical introduction and explanation of the method before resubmitting.

 The paper introduces a new intrinsic reward for MARL, representing the causal influence of an agent’s action on another agent counterfactually . The authors show this causal influence reward is related to maximising the mutual information between the agents’ actions . This reward is tested in a set of social dilemmas, where it leads to increased cooperation and communication protocols . The causal influence term can be thought of as a form of reward shaping .
Gold Metareview 197:
The reviewers raised a number of concerns including the appropriateness of the chosen application and the terms in which social dilemmas have been discussed, the lack of explanations and discussions, missing references, and the extent of the evaluation studies. The authors’ rebuttal addressed some of the reviewers’ concerns but not fully. Overall, I believe that the work is interesting and may be useful to the community (though to a small extent., in my opinion). However, the paper would benefit from additional explanations, experiments and discussions pointed in quite some detail by the reviewers. AS is, the paper is below the acceptance threshold for presentation at ICLR.

The sampling from hindsight experience is partially based on the likelihood of the corresponding state-action pair under the current policy . The reviewer is not sure that this strategy makes sense when applied to off-policy RL methods . The authors evaluate the proposed method on 3 simulated robotics manipulation tasks and compare against HER-EBP and CHER as baselines . The paper does not include discussion or empirical evaluations for such tasks .
Gold Metareview 198:
This paper extends the idea of hindsight experience replay (HER) to learn Q functions with relative goals by constructing a distribution over relative goals sampled from a replay buffer using a clustering algorithm. This approach is evaluated on three multi-goal RL environments and is shown to learn faster than baselines.

${\bf Pros}$:
1. Faster convergence as compared to baselines
2. Interesting use of clustering in the context of HER but this choice is made without strong justifications or formal arguments

${\bf Cons}$:
1. Some of the key choices made in this paper are not justified or explained property, e.g. - the goal sampling strategy, choices made in the clustering algorithm and associated heuristics, implicit assumptions (e.g. R1 raised the question of using L2 distance in measuring metrics between two states) 
2. There are several choices made without sufficient formal arguments, verification or guarantees. 

The paper studies an interesting problem but could be made stronger by incorporating feedback received during the discussion period.

 Equilibrium propagation is a promising framework to learn neural networks in a biologically plausible way . However, it is sensitive to noise, making it hard to scale to large machine learning tasks . The authors introduce a new variant of equilibrium propagation that relies on complex analysis and holomorphic functions . They show that this new algorithm is more robust to noise than traditional equilibrium propagation . The paper presents a novel idea which greatly increases the power of a local learning rule using the elegance of complex analysis .
Gold Metareview 199:
Equilibrium propagation is a biologically plausible form of backpropagation based learning where the true gradient of an energy based model is computed for infinitesimal perturbations. In this innovative work, authors extend EP using complex analysis that links contour integrals for finite perturbations with the oscillatory dynamics in time. This not only allows better gradient estimates, but also applications to related theories of learning in neuroscience as well as neuromorphic engineering. It represents a significant advance that opens new doors.


Generated Summary 200:
 The paper studies an online allocation setting where arriving items are allocated among $n$ agents who are "promised" a prespecified fraction of the items . The goal of the planner is to maximize the total valuation of the agents . The planner does not know the realized valuation at each period, but also the distribution of the values . The paper provides an algorithm that satisfies approximate Bayesian incentive compatibility . It is the first to propose an approximate BIC policy with sublinear regret .
Gold Metareview 200:
Executive summary:

The authors study the repeated allocation of an identical good over T rounds to n strategic buyers in a "no monetary transfers" setting. The buyers have i.i.d. valuations drawn from an unknown distribution, and the algorithm must work with reported valuations. The goal is to maximize social welfare (= sum of valuations) under the constraint that each buyer receives a pre-specified fraction of the total number of goods. 

The main result is an algorithm for this problem that ensures two things: 

(a) approximate Bayesian incentive compatibility (approx-BIC) (Definition 2 and Theorem 1) and 

(b) low individual regret (Definition 3 and Theorem 2). 

The key idea of the algorithm (is to exploit the iid-ness of the problem) and detect misreports from the underlying CDF using Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz type bounds.

Discussion and recommendation:

After some initial set back on the problem motivation, the reviewers bought into the motivation for studying this online allocation problem "without monetary transfers" (adding examples such as the foodbank example might be good).  

There was some discussion around "assuming iid valuations" limiting the generality of the result, but there is in fact a history of papers that studies learning with strategic agents under this assumption (eg Kanoria and Nazerzadeh 2021).

The main difference of the current work is that it's working in a setting without money.

The idea behind the algorithm is maybe "the obvious think to do" - but of course it still requires some work to formally prove that it actually works. 

I think one thing that could strengthen the paper would be to add some discussion around the tightness/non-tightness of the approximate BIC and individual regret bounds.

Weak accept.

 This paper proposes a new KD method to inherit classifier from teacher models and utilize it to train the student model feature representation . Shared classifier yields better aligned embedding space, so embeddings from teacher and student models are comparable . Since the optimization objective for student model is learning discriminative embeddeddings, the face recognition performance is improved compared to the vanilla KL counterpart . The paper demonstrates using an ensemble of teacher models can boost the performance .
Gold Metareview 201:
This paper presents a knowledge distillation method for face recognition, by inheriting the teacher’s classifier as the student’s classifier and optimizing the student model with advanced loss functions. It received comments from three reviewers: 1 rated “Ok but not good enough - rejection”, 1 rated “Marginally below” and 1 rated “Marginally above”. The reviewers appreciate the simple yet clear methodology illustration and the well written paper. However, a number of major concerns are raised by the reviewers, including limited novelty, lack of comparison with more advanced knowledge distillation methods and their special case in face recognition. During the rebuttal, the authors made efforts to response to all reviewers’ comments. However, the rating were not changed. The ACs concur these major concerns and more comprehensive comparisons with the state of the art KD methods are necessary to better illustrate the contribution of this work. Therefore, this paper can not be accepted at its current state.

The method is well-motivated in general, however, I feel the notation in Alg 1 is a little bit unclear . I am not that familiar with hierarchical RL, so I could not give a fair judgement of the novelty compared with previous option learning literature .
Gold Metareview 205:
There was a fair amount of discussion about the paper.  Several reviewers felt that the paper would have been stronger if it tried to do less but better.  The reviews describe in detail what the reviewers would have found compelling, but the key suggestion is to remove the complexity that is not essential for the approach to provide consistent improvements.  Doing this requires a better understanding of the algorithm's behavior and a valid ablation study, a new concern raised during the discussion with the authors. 

The reviewers felt that the proposed approach is potentially interesting and would like to see this paper done well.

(2021) The explanation of the empirical results is not insightful and convincing enough .
Gold Metareview 207:
This paper set out to show that increasing task diversity during meta-training process does not boost performance. The reviewers mostly  agreed (only reviewer wVFn dissented) that the empirical set up of the paper was convincing, but they also felt it over-emphasized empirics over a deeper understanding of the phenomena observed. In turn, this resulted in discussions around how the experiments and the explanations didn't fully prove that increasing task diversity does not help. Overall, the discussion and the additional analysis tools provided by the authors (such as the diversity metric) will greatly improve the paper.

 A paper proposes Bayes Augmented with Memory (BAM) is a learning framework where a recursive adaptation of the Bayes formula is augmented with selection variables to allow an agent to adaptively choose past experiences to forget . BAM generalizes many popular Bayesian update rules for non-stationary environments . While the method seems technically sound, the method still falls short of the following points: scalability, the algorithm will fail in an online learning environment .
Gold Metareview 209:
The article introduces a Bayesian approach for online learning in non-stationary environments. The approach, which bears similarities with weighted likelihood estimation methods, associate a binary weight to each past observation, indicating if this observation should be including or not to compute the posterior. The weights are estimated via maximum a posteriori. 

The paper is well written, the approach is novel and its usefulness demonstrated on a number of different experiments. The original submission missed some relevant references that have been added in the revision. The approach has some limitations, highlighted by the reviewers:
* it requires to solve a binary optimisation problem whose complexity scales exponentially with the size of the dataset; although the greedy procedure proposed by the authors seems to work fine on the examples shown, the approach may not be applicable to larger datasets
* it requires to store all the data
* it requires the traceability of the marginal likelihood

Despite these limitations, there was a general agreement that this paper offers a novel and useful contribution, and I recommend acceptance. 

As noted by reviewer o4TK, I also think that the title is not very accurate. Bayesian methods naturally allow recursive updates of one's beliefs, and therefore have "memory". Maybe change the title for "Bayes with augmented selective/adaptive memory"?

That global optimum can be provably achieved using damped parallel mean-field updates, which make inference efficient . The significance of this paper is not high, and evaluation is weak .
Gold Metareview 212:
This is an interesting contribution to the Boltzmann machine (BM) literature that makes a nice connection to DEQ models. On a positive note, reviewers found that it was well-written, clear, and interesting. Unfortunately, there were significant concerns with the manuscript that were not fully addressed in the revision: inappropriate or incomplete baselines, insufficient credit given to previous works, and the fact that this model is limited as compared to its BM relatives.

I would recommend that the authors take into account the reviewers' feedback in a revision of the work.

 First Hitting Diffusion Models (FHDM) is a class of generative models that generalize the fixed time diffusion probabilistic models . Learning and inference are achieved by approximating drift term in the corresponding Ito diffusion process with a neural network . The strength of the paper is the introduction of a new (to the best of my knowledge) data generation methodologies suitable for arbitrary domains . The reviewer finds out a few typos and has difficulties reading the proof since the statements of the manuscript are disorganized .
Gold Metareview 213:
The paper introduces a new approach for generative modeling: a diffusion process is run until it first hits a target set, and then outputs the first point that is hit. 

Three reviewers generally praised the originality, technical quality, and empirical results of the paper. They found the idea very interesting and novel, and technically sound. The numerical results were judged to be compelling and fair. One concern was clarity of exposition. There seemed to be two issues: (1) there were more typos and rough edges than expected, (2) more significantly, there was some difficulty in following all details of the main method given the notational complexity and significant amount of mathematical background on diffusion processes. Reviewer FUwB gave a number of concrete suggestions for improvement.

Reviewer wpmu had a negative overall opinion and critiqued the originality, quality, and clarity. On these issues: (1) the quality concern was based on a misunderstanding that was later resolved, (2) the originality concern does not seem justified to the meta-reviewer (it is based on a shared technical tool with a not-yet-published paper), and (3) the clarity concern is similar to those raised by other reviewers (especially FUwB). Overall, the meta-reviewer does not feel that the low score (3 = “reject”) was fully justified. 

In summary, overall reviewers found the paper sound and novel, with the main area for improvement being clarity of exposition about diffusion processes; one reviewer considered originality a weakness, but the meta-reviewer did not find this position well justified. 


Generated Summary 214:
 This paper proposes reducing slip during dynamic motions by adapting the trajectory, specifically decreasing the velocity . This is in contrast to previous papers which normally focus on moderating gripping force . The paper argues that in several scenarios, such as manipulating delicate objects, it may be undesirable to simply grip harder . The goal of this work is to develop a slip control mechanism for robot manipulation tasks where objects being manipulated may move relative to the gripper due to insufficient shear force .
Gold Metareview 214:
This paper presents a method for preventing slips in point-to-point motions while grasping an object using LSTM-based models for detecting and predicting slips. This approach is effective when contact force cannot be increased. Reactive and proactive controllers are presented, and the latter demonstrated better performance. 

The paper proposes an interesting approach to slip prevention especially useful for handling delicate objects. The authors successfully addressed most of the concerns raised by the reviewers, while expanding the dataset and examples will be addressed in a future journal paper. Nevertheless, the paper will make a valuable contribution to the conference.

 AlignKGC is a neural model that performs knowledge graph completion (KGC) on multilingual knowledge graphs that have entity and relation overlap . The resulting model demonstrates strong empirical results on DBP5L for all three tasks . KGC is evaluated on each of 5 languages for which a KG is available . It proposes a model which jointly optimizes the three tasks using a linear combination of their losses . The paper is extremely clear, and results show significant improvements over the baselines .
Gold Metareview 215:
This paper introduces AlignKGC, a neural model that performs entity alignment (EA), relation alignment (RA), and knowledge graph completion (KGC) on multilingual knowledge graphs. The model jointly optimizes for the linear combination of losses for all 3 tasks. The authors present a convincing set of experiments to show that each of these tasks helps the other two. The paper is well written and demonstrates strong empirical results on DBLP5L containing 5 languages on all 3 tasks. Results are reproducible as both the code and data are made public. No major concerns after the author's response.

 The paper study the effects of adding random features (RF) to graph neural networks (GNN) The theoretical aspect seems novel and quite surprising, especially since it shows that adding RF makes GNN more expressive than k-GCN (or k-IGN) for any k . The paper analyzes the model of Random features in GNNs as suggested by Sato et.al.al., in the paper called RNI . A result proving the universality of the RNI framework is introduced .
Gold Metareview 216:
In this paper, the authors show the effect of RNI on the expressive power of GNN for the first time, where the RNI was initially proposed in Sato et al. 2020. Overall, I like the idea of random node initialization because it is simple, effective, and theoretically well-founded. The key concern was that the novelty over the Sato's paper and the reviewers were still not convinced by the response. Therefore, the paper is still below the acceptance threshold.  I strongly encourage authors to revise the paper based on the reviewer's comments and resubmit it to a future venue. 


Generated Summary 217:
 This paper examines the impact of forcing units in a CNN to be more or less ‘class-selective” – i.e. respond preferentially to one image class compared to another . The approach taken is to include a regularizer in the loss that directly penalizes or encourages class selectivity in individual units . The authors report that penalizing class selectionivity at intermediate layers has little-to-no effect on classification performance, and in some cases mildly improves performance . Conversely, encouraging selectivity dramatically decreases performance .
Gold Metareview 217:
This paper has received three positive reviews. In general, the reviewers have commented on the importance of the question related to how much selectivity is needed from units of a neural network for good classification -- from both the neuroscience and ML perspectives. The reviewers also commented on the thoroughness of the experiments and the general readability of the paper. This paper should be accepted if possible.

Generated Summary 218:
 A paper proposed a just-in-time optimization method of neural network calculation on dynamic computation graphs . The method focused on batching summation of gradients on the backward calculation which was performed independently in conventional toolkits . The authors implement this batching strategy in DyNet and show empirically that it can lead to decent (0-25%) speedups . Delaying computations until several can be batched together can increase peak memory usage .
Gold Metareview 218:
This paper describes a new batching strategy for more efficient training of deep neural nets. The idea stems from the observation that some operations can only be batched more efficiently in the backward, suggesting that batching should be different between forward and backward. The results show that the proposed method improves upon existing batch strategies across three tasks. The reviewers find the work novel, but note that it does not properly address the trade-offs made by the technique - such as memory consumption. They also argue that the writing should be improved before acceptance at ICLR.

Generated Summary 219:
 This paper describes a few-shot learning approach that takes into account the semantic relatedness of the ground truth labels rather than just using them as binary labels . In principal adding textual data that is semantically less ambiguous than image data helps . Empirically they show that using such semantic features clearly shows improvements over visual features . The effect of using pre-trained feature extractor $E_theta is unclear . The proposed method seems incremental to me because it predicts the semantic features for the query set from the support set .
Gold Metareview 219:
This paper proposes a few-shot learning method that learns task-adaptive semantic features that can incorporate for both of the support and query sets. Two approaches for modality combination are developed. The additional experiments in the author response addressed some concerns of the reviewers. However, the technical novelty of the proposed method is high enough since the proposed method uses existing techniques.

Generated Summary 220:
 The paper proposes a method to address the transfer learning in the multi-task learning setup . It consists of mixup applied between target samples and source samples from the class pre-determined to be closest to target sample’s class . The main disadvantage is its limited novelty, poor analysis, and marginal improvements . Experiments conducted transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet to 6 smaller image classification datasets demonstrate XMixUp to outperform the baseline approaches .
Gold Metareview 220:
All reviewers recommend rejection due to limited novelty and insufficient experimental analysis. The author’s response has addressed several other questions raised by the reviewers, but it was not sufficient to eliminate the main concerns about novelty (as the method is a combination of existing techniques) and missing comparisons to justify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 The authors propose an adversarial attack strategy for graph neural networks based on influence maximization . The attack is (claimed to be) black-box (does not have direct access to the model), evasion-based, and limited to perturbations of the node attributes . The proposed attack outperforms the centrality-based baselines of [Ma et al. 2020]. The improvement of the proposed attack over RWCS/GC-RWCS is marginal (less than 3 percent)
Gold Metareview 221:
This paper relates the problem of influence maximization and adversarial attacks on GCNs. 
The paper, and its formulation and assumptions stirred up quite a discussion among the reviewers and the authors. I do appreciate the thorough rebuttal that the authors provided, and the reviewers did take it into account (and revised their scores). 
However, all in all, I am afraid that there are just a few too many concerns with this paper. 
If the authors take the reviews to heart, they should be able to improve the manuscript and submit a stronger and improved version to the next conference. 

Generated Summary 222:
 A new framework leverages assistive information generated from counterfactual predictions of optimal joint action selection . Experiments show that the proposed method overperforms many baselines including QMIX . The paper proposes that in partially observable MARL problems, the agent's ordering of its own action may impose concurrency constraints on the representation function . To remedy the errors they allow for agents to communicate and explicitly encourage them to send messages that improve the learning of the optimal actions for each agent .
Gold Metareview 222:
After reading the reviews and feedbacks, I lean towards acceptance. A majority of reviewers gave a positive score after the rebuttal period and some concern were answered in the authors response. Specifically authors have shown that the recent baselines they use outperform other baselines and therefore those do not need to be added in the paper, they have also clarified some proofs and some notations. Overall, the reviewers found the method presented interesting, the paper well written and appreciated the comparison to other methods of the literature. Finally, experiments shows interesting results on large scale domains which is a sign that the proposed method could scale up.

 This paper tries to prove that there is a bottleneck in feature learning for long-tailed classification . Data augmentation can help relieve the issues in long-tail feature space . The weakness: The paper is based on the unserious term "good enough" This paper seeks to study what is the bottleneck in learning . Based on extensive experiments, the authors propose that representation learning is a bottlenecks . This paper analyzes representation learning from the perspectives of intra-class compactness and inter-class separation .
Gold Metareview 223:
This paper investigates the role of representation learning when the distribution over the feature space has a long tail. The main motivation is to determine how much of the overall learning, in this case, is bottlenecked specifically by representation learning. The main findings are that vanilla learning gives brittle long-tailed representations, harming overall performance. The paper suggests a form of data augmentation to remedy this. Reviewers acknowledge that this investigation is worthwhile. However, many concerns were raised as to whether experiments support the drawn conclusions. A more principled approach to the data augmentation methodology is also needed. The authors address some of these, providing further experiments, but these were not enough to sway reviewers. Since results are fundamentally empirical in nature, this shortcoming indicates that the paper is not ready to share with the community just yet. Stronger experiments with clearer evidence are needed to fully support the thesis of the work.

Generated Summary 224:
 This paper studies the role of activation functions (via their multiplicity at the origin) in the condensation of neural networks at the initial training stage . Condensation can be viewed as a feature learning process, where the wide network can be described effectively as a narrower network and the input weights condense on isolated orientations during training . This condensation restricts the capacity of NNs at the beginning, working as implicit regularization . Broadly, this work is intriguing, but could stand to benefit from a few improvements .
Gold Metareview 224:
*Summary:* Study isolated orientations of weights for networks with small initialization depending on multiplicity of activation functions. 

*Strengths:* 
- Interesting analysis of properties in early stages depending on activations. 

*Weaknesses:* 
- Reviewers found the settings limited. 
- Reviewers found experiments limited.  

*Discussion:*

In response to ejGJ authors reiterate scope of covered cases and submit to consideration that their experiments should be adequate for basic research. Reviewer acknowledges the response, but maintains their assessment (limited scope of theory, limited experiments). KucV found the experimental part limited in scope, the settings unclear (notion of early stage, compatibility with theory), and review of previous works lacking. KucV’s sincerely acknowledged authors for their efforts to address their comments and improving the manuscript, and raised their score, but maintained the experimental analysis is not fully convincing and unclear, and the comparison with prior work insufficient. zuZq also expressed concerns with the experiments and the notions and settings under consideration. They also raised questions about the comparison with standard initialization. Authors made efforts to address zuZq concerns. zuZq acknowledged this but maintained initial position that the article is just marginally above threshold. jDJ5 found the paper well written and the conclusion insightful. However, also raised concerns about the experiments the settings under consideration. Authors made efforts to address jDJ5’s concerns, who appreciated this but was not convinced to raise their score. 

*Conclusion:*  
Two reviewers consider this article marginally above and two more marginally below the acceptance threshold. I find the article draws an interesting connection pertaining an interesting topic. However, the reviews and discussion conclude that the article lacks in several regards that in my view still could and should be improved. Therefore I am recommending reject at this time. I encourage the authors to revise and resubmit.

 This is one of the first papers doing BERT-style pretraining for vision transformers . It is inspired by the contrastive self-supervised learning approach like DINO and the mask modelling approach like BeiT .

 Using O(n polylog images one can recover all private images in the InstaHide challenge . This is an improvement over previous works in two ways: 1) The paper shows how to recover all images rather than few (or 1) images . However, the running time of the algorithm is exponential in the number of private images . My main concern of this submission is its limited scope: the conclusion provides limited value for people outside of this area .

All reviewers agree that this is a reasonable contribution but that it is also extremely limited in scope. The authors suggest in one of their response that their technique could apply to "any data mixing method with “batched k-sum” structure". Such a larger level of generality might make the paper more interesting, but at the moment it is an extremely niche result.

Generated Summary 227:
 The current structure of the paper is very unusual what makes the presentation of the key results very unclear . The authors study Lyapunov chaos that occur in learning in non-zero-sum games . It is still unclear how the obtained results can improve learning algorithms and/or improve their application in practice . The work is original and significant . The paper could benefit from additional discussion and explanation of the claims, says the author of the review .
Gold Metareview 227:
This paper looks at chaos in learning in games, extending a line of work in two players zero-sum games (that I found quite restrictive in the past). It somehow reduces the class of more general games to zero-sum and cooperative games (this decomposition is already known) so that the techniques can be transposed here.

The paper is interesting, yet sometimes difficult to follow, and I am not certain that it gives many new insights. 

Nonetheless, we believe its quality justify acceptance.

Empirical experiments on supervisied learning and reinforcement learning tasks show that MemUP significantly boost the results over its baselines .
Gold Metareview 228:
The reviewers found the ideas presented in the paper interesting -- the use of mutual information to train memory for a model, and the clear presentation. Some questions were raised about demonstrating on a more elaborate set up such as NLP tasks -- the main experiments aside from the toy experiments of copy, etc algorithmic tasks, seem to be on RL experiments, but the method has been advertised more broadly in the motivation. Another reviewer raised the question of the complexity of training multiple networks. Nevertheless, the reviewers found the paper interesting enough to recommend a weak accept and I support that recommendation.

From a reviewers lens, I was a little surprised that the paper made no mention of prior works on maximizing mutual information between features of neural networks to improve results. As an example, see the following paper [1] that uses a mutual information regularizer between states at different steps of a recurrent neural networks. There is also a rich literature of doing so for convolutional neural networks. It would have made sense to compare how the idea in the paper performed in comparison to these methods (and in a sense the ablation study which looked at randomly choosing time steps, k, (regardless of the uncertainty estimator) is an experiment in this direction). I understand that part of the paper deals with the choice of time points to increase mutual information between, and so its probably more efficient than the other alternatives, but a comparison (or discussion in related works) would have made the paper stronger.

 A new dataset for multimodal visuo-tactile learning called Touch and Go is proposed, in which human data collectors probe objects in natural environments with tactile sensors . The data are collected by human in an “approximately egocentric” manner, which is thought to have higher diversity than those collected by robots . The functionality of the dataset remains undetermined . The motivation of the proposed tactile-driven image stylization is not clearly stated, and the qualitative results seem trivial .
Gold Metareview 229:
Overall, all reviewers see the novelty in the dataset that provides an original new set of tactile data, accounting for a wide range of objects and scene, collected in the wild. The paper is overall well written, clear and easy to follow, and provides a good demonstration of the importance and usefulness of the dataset, going beyond datasets collected by robots in the context of material properties. It also includes initial steps towards benchmarking, although it is not the core contribution of the paper, which lies in the creation of the dataset itself. 

Two reviewers recommend acceptance, two stand marginally below acceptance, and one does recommend rejection. The authors have provided detailed responses to all reviewers’ comments and concerns and updated their manuscript. The main concerns of those reviewers sitting on the fence seem to be answered and limitations acknowledged however the element of bias in the data collection was still considered as a possible concern. Based on my reading and accounting for the authors changes, there approach itself is novel and original and hence provides already a relevant contribution to NeuroIPS; while the authors acknowledge limitations and future work avenues. The one reviewer recommending rejection didn’t engage in the discussion but from my reading of both the paper, the comments, and the authors responses, I believe the main points were addressed by the authors and misunderstandings clarified. Overall, I believe the papers offers a novel, non-existing dataset that can inspire interesting future works; all the dataset is shared and presented clearly for others to use.

 This paper proposes a method VAEL, which combines VAE and ProbLog . The main idea is to interpret a subset z_sym of the latent representation z of VAE as symbolic representation of input . A neural network maps a neural network to probabilities of facts in a ProbLog program . VAEL has better generalization and requires less training samples . The proposed method is still an early-stage one (the experiments are limited and the proposed method should have been better motivated .
Gold Metareview 230:
The paper proposes to include a component enforcing logical constraints on top of a variational autoencoder (VAE). The resulting method, VAEL. does so by leveraging ProbLog in addition to a neural encoder and decoder. VAEL is employed for simple generative tasks with constraints over the outputs, such as conditional image generation with MNIST and small Mario levels.

The reviewers have appreciated the direction where VAEL is heading and the importance of integrating constraints in deep generative models. Some concerns are still open. Specifically, the motivation behind some architectural choices (and the specific choice of VAEs as deep generative models) and the small-scale nature of the experiments. The complexity and scaling campabilities of performing symbolic reasoning with ProbLog are not discussed in depth.

This paper presents Recommender Transformer (RETR) with a pathway attention mechanism that can dynamically zeroing-out the interactions (e.g., the trivial/noisy ones) in transformer-based sequential recommender systems. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. 

Overall this paper received mixed reviews with borderline scores. The reviewers raised concerns around baselines and evaluations, some of which the authors promptly addressed in the revision during the rebuttal period. I also read the paper in details myself. I do agree with some of the concerns from the reviewers but I don't think a method needs to beat every other published papers to be published (and I think the current baselines are more than thorough enough). My biggest complaint about the paper is around the writing, specifically, how the proposed idea is presented. 

This paper tries to tackle an important question, which is that in sequential recommendation, not every interactions are useful in helping predict future interaction. The self-attention mechanism in transformer kind of addresses this problem but in a more "softer" fashion with attention weights. This paper presents a simple yet effective method to introduce a pathway mechanism that adaptively zeroing-out some of the interactions via a binary pathway router. In order to train such a model end-to-end, Gumbel-softmax sampling is utilized.

The most important part of the contribution to me is that this is an improvement to the transformer architecture, as opposed to a new model which is what this paper's writing suggests -- the proposed approach is effectively model-agonistic and doesn't marry to a particular loss function or finer-grained architectural choices (number of layers, etc.). Currently there are many baselines in the paper, but each made some different model/architecture choices, which could contribute to the difference in performance (or not, but we wouldn't know). An ideal evaluation should have been to take all the transformer-based baselines that are currently in the paper, add this pathway mechanism without changing anything else, and show that the results improved over the transformer architecture. In this way, we know the improvements are exactly coming from introducing the pathway. The authors might argue some of the current results are already supporting this argument, but my point is to emphasize this point very explicitly rather than leaving it for the readers to infer. 

From what I read in this paper, I truly believe this pathway idea has its potential. Therefore, I would especially want the authors to further refine the presentation to better convey the idea, which in turn will hopefully increase the impact of this paper once it is eventually published. 

Some minor comments:
* The way the paper is currently written seems to suggest there are only three types of pathways and the network is capable of capturing all of them. I am personally not a big of fan of over-interpreting what a neural net is trying to do. Therefore, I wouldn't overly focus on the characterization of different pathways and only show the qualitative examples at the end as a high-level demonstration.
* In Eq 2 "softmax" should really be "sigmoid" if a 0-1 prediction is made there. Then the following line "logit" is probably not the right word here. 
* The qualitative examples at the end (figure 3) can be more carefully examined/labeled. For example, the current categorization is quite ambiguous -- "Indie" refers to the type of developers while "JPG" refers to the genre of the game, they are certainly not mutually exclusive.

 The paper addresses a long-standing problem of deep neural networks where new training data for new tasks arrive continuously and data does not stay forever . The paper introduces a new method, Recursive Gradient Optimization (RGO) for continual learning in the task-incremental scenario .

This paper proposes an innovative method for continual learning that modifies the direction of gradients on a new task to minimise forgetting on previous tasks without data replay. The method is mathematically rigorous with a strong theoretical analysis and excellent empirical results across multiple continual learning benchmarks. It is a clear accept.

 This paper studies the problem of distribution shifts as out-of-distribution generalization . It formulates the OOD problem as invariant risk minimization under different environments . The main idea is to decompose the graph into a set of ego-graphs rooted at each node . Since the learning objective requires data from different environments they introduce auxiliary context generators trained to maximize the variance loss . This paper will be attractive for many graph-related machine learning researchers .
Gold Metareview 233:
The reviewers have improved their scores after the rebuttal, and I agree that the work has value. It proposes a model-driven data augmentation approach to environment-invariant graph representation. Just like most data augmentation works in graph representation learning, the approach relies on graph proposal generator. The work has an implicit mechanism hidden in the graph generator (the authors' reply to a reviewer that "we target the extrapolation via a new invariant learning approach that is agnostic to specific GNN models" is a misunderstanding of why & how these types of methods work). The submission could significantly improve the introduction by properly describing the work w.r.t. other OOD efforts in graph representation learning. While the tasks of different works may be different (e.g., graph classification vs node classification), it is important to emphasize what each different approach brings to the table (rather than just state that the tasks are different). I hope the authors take this opportunity to improve the introduction. This work is more similar to the former OOD graph representation works than IRM & REX, since (without modeling assumptions) both IRM and REX require the support of the environments in test to be a subset of the ones in training. The present work does not need this support assumption since it uses an implicit mechanism in the graph generator.

The toy example in Section 3.1 is informative, thank you. The theory looks solid and easy to understand. The technical novelty is limited, since once the input graph has been decomposed into a set of ego-graphs the definitions, formulations, and theory are all straightforward adaptations from the respective versions for IID data. 

Minor:
- In Assumption 2, m() should be defined inside the assumption.

Gold Metareview 234:
This paper presents a way to use a translation memory (TM) to improve neural machine translation.  Basically the proposed model uses a n-gram retrieve matching sentence （or pieces） and takes advantage of the useful parts using gated attention and copying mechanism.  Although the idea of leveraging TM in the context of NMT is not new,  this work seems to be a fair contribution. My major concerns are the following
1. The retrieval part  is not clearly presented, raising questions about  complexities and the noise brought by the common words. The authors should give a better exposition on the ranking mechanism. 
2. The experiments are not convincing enough since the proposed model is not compared to the SOTA and the competitive models described in the prior work.

Overall, the paper is capturing a really timely and increasingly important topic. Although the authors mention that they want to make their dataset particularly useful for academics/future research, I believe, that the topic is of great interest for companies, making the raised ethical considerations even more important. A critical reflection upon possibly ‘unintended uses’ can’t be emphasised enough, as well as possible biases in the data. However, I appreciated that the authors have done a fantastic job in their response and strengthening their article. Moreover, all reviewers recognise the utility and relevance of the proposed dataset and the authors did provide satisfactory responses to all raised concerns/comments. I believe this paper will stimulate some interesting and hopefully critical reflections on how to use/or not use the dataset and future improvements to overcome dataset biases.

The bulk of backdoor attacks have been patch-based and this is one of few works that explore other backdoor alternatives . To bypass backdoor detectors, the authors also propose a ‘noise’ mode of training poisoned classifiers . The authors propose a noise-based “noise mode” mode .
Gold Metareview 239:
The paper presents a new method for generation of backdoor attacks against deep networks. The new method uses global warping instead of noise patches which makes the attack much more stealthy than previous approaches. The attack effectiveness is demonstrated on 3 benchmark datasets. A small user study is carried out to demonstrate that the attack is stealthier than conventional backdoor attacks. 

The new attack is a novel and original contribution which is likely to advance the understanding of backdoor attacks. There were some issues with respect to clarity in the original manuscript but the authors adequately addressed the critical remarks raised by the reviewers.

 This paper revisits the cascading bandits problem where the decision maker must choose an ordered list of $K$ distinct items . Decision maker only observes Bernoulli feedback (governed by the underlying attraction probabilities) for the items that were examined . This work completely resolves this problem for $K\leq L/4$. This work closed the gap for the upper and lower bounds on the regret in the tabular setting and studied the linear setting .

All the reviewers were generally happy with this paper. There were some comments about a better experimental section and maybe a better discussion of results and extensions (e.g. gap-dependent bounds, what happens in the K->L regime), but everyone felt that the manuscript as written was solid enough to merit acceptance. I encourage the authors to incorporate the discussions on these points in the final manuscript.






Generated Summary 241:
 This paper proposed a unified sequence interface (Pix2seq ++) for computer vision tasks . The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 benchmarks . The keypoint tokenization is not clear to me. I wonder which one is the correct format for key points . The results are promising as it could initiate a new research line unifying different vision and vision+language tasks . There are some concerns about novelty and whether the work is just incremental compared to previous work .
Gold Metareview 241:
Four reviewers provided reviews for this submission. Several reviewers felt that the idea to unify core vision tasks into a sequential output format is interesting and an entirely new approach and can have a large impact on how we train vision models in the future. There were a few concerns discussed between reviewers and authors. One concern was the comparison to past works that pre-trained on ImageNet vs the proposed model that was pre-trained on Objects365. The second concern was differentiating this work with Pix2Seq. In my opinion, the authors were able to answer both questions well. Overall, given the positive reviews, novelty of the work, potential to cause a significant shift in the approach of future modeling and discussion, I recommend acceptance. 


Generated Summary 242:
 The paper proposes a method to improve adversarial robustness of the current convolutional networks . The method is based on dropping outputs of a fraction of neurons . However, unlike in dropout masks the masks are kept fixed throughout training/inference . This shifts the focus of the network away from texture and towards shape features . The Stylized-Imagenet experiment is potentially compromised by virtue of being very out of distribution to the ordinary ImageNet .
Gold Metareview 242:
The paper presents a method to make CNN focus more on structure rather than texture by constraining a random set of neurons per feature map to have constant activation. 
The paper has limited novelty and unclear analysis of the experimental results, for instance plots of accuracy vs strength of adversarial perturbation should be produced. Tables are not readable and results tend to be cluttered and confusing.  Some comparisons seem to be cherry picked as pointed out by some reviewers.
Although the approach seems to be well received by the reviewers they all shared similar concerns about having a stronger motivation and better validation of the approach (that is not amount of comparisons but the right comparisons that would clear doubts and make the work directly comparable to others).
I strongly encourage the authors to perform a deeper analysis and to clearly work on hypothesis and validation of their work. In my opinion, although the reviewers think different, the experiments are not sufficient to validate the strong claim of the paper.

Generated Summary 243:
 The paper proposes a model that combines a normalizing flow on top of a linear diffusion model, effectively modeling a nonlinear diffusion . Empirically, such nonlinearity results in a tighter variational gap compared to the linear diffusion and other baselines . The paper validates the PDM on image modeling benchmarks (CIFAR-10 and CelebA 64x64) The experiments show the method leads to reduced variational gaps between the data likelihood and the evidence lower bound used for training the model .
Gold Metareview 243:
This paper presents a simple approach called PDM for composing non-linear and complex normalizing flows with score-based generative models. Since score-based models can be considered as a special form of continuous-time normalizing flows, PDM corresponds to a composition of different classes of normalizing flows. 

Pros: 
* Combining generic normalizing flows with score-based models is an interesting direction as they have different characteristics and can be complementary to each other.
* Using Ito's lemma to show that the model learns a non-linear SDE in data space is valuable. 
* The authors show that the variational gap can be reduced using normalizing flows.

Cons: 
* The proposed method does not exhibit a clear advantage compared to the diffusion baseline without the normalizing flow component. On the CIFAR10 dataset, the best NLL and FID results are obtained by the diffusion baseline.

* Theorem 2 makes a very unrealistic assumption that a flow network is flexible enough to transform $p_r$ to any arbitrary distribution. If this holds, we wouldn't need the score-based generation model anymore. We could simply train the normalizing flow to map the input data distribution to a Normal distribution.

* This submission chooses to discuss differences with the recent LSGM framework. However, in doing so, several inaccurate claims are made. The lack of inference data diffusion in LSGM is mentioned as one of its drawbacks. However, it is not clear what is the value of having such a mechanism and what implications it may have on the expressivity of the model. Note that mapping from data space to latent space in VAEs can be considered as a stochastic inversion rather than an exact inversion. Ito's lemma does not require invertibility and it can be easily applied to the forward and generative diffusion in LSGM. The authors argue that applying it to the forward diffusion in LSGM will result in $\hat{p_{r}}\ne p_{r}$. But, $\hat{p_{r}}$ would be only considered for visualization of the forward diffusion and it is not used for training or any other purposes. LSGM, the proposed PDM, and score-based models are all trained with a reweighting of ELBO (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02808)). It is not clear if the drawback mentioned above has an impact on the training or expressivity of the model.

* The presentation in the paper requires improvement. The motivation on why invertibility plays a key role is not clear beyond generating the visualization in Figure 2. 

In summary, the paper proposes an interesting idea and explores directions very relevant to the current focus in generative learning. However, given the concerns above, we don't believe that the paper in its current form is ready for presentation at ICLR.

 The paper describes a novel implementation of RED, regularization by denoising . The proposed implementation splits the gradient step into smaller components, which can each be executed independently on different cores and then used to update a shared copy .

Generated Summary 249:
 This paper addresses the problem of language drift in multi-agent communication paradigms . When two pretrained natural-language agents are jointly optimized to communicate, their internal communication often diverges to a code-like, unnatural communication system . This paper solves this “language drift” problem by requiring that the messages between agents be usable as inputs to an image caption retrieval system . The gains are unfortunately much weaker than I would have hoped for .
Gold Metareview 249:
This paper proposes a method to resolve "language drift," where a pre-trained X->language model trained in an X->language->Y pipeline drifts away from being natural language. In particular, it proposes to add an auxiliary training objective that performs grounding with multimodal input to fix this problem. Results are good on a task where translation is done between two languages.

The main concern that was raised with this paper by most of the reviewers is the validity of the proposed task itself. Even after extensive discussion with the authors, it is not clear that there is a very convincing scenario where we both have a pre-trained X->language, care about the intermediate results, and have some sort of grounded input to fix this drift. While I do understand the MT task is supposed to be a testbed for the true objective, it feel it is necessary to additionally have one convincing use case where this is a real problem and not just the artificially contrived. This use case could either be of practical use (e.g. potentially useful in an application), or of interest from the point of view of cognitive plausibility (e.g. similar to how children actually learn, and inspired by cognitive science literature).

A concern that offshoots from this is that because the underlying idea is compelling (some sort of grounding to inform language learning), a paper at a high-profile conference such as ICLR may help re-popularize this line of research, which has been a niche for a while. Normally I would say this is definitely a good thing; I think considering grounding in language learning is definitely an important research direction, and have been a fan of this line of work since reading Roy's seminal work on it from 15 years ago. However, if the task used in this paper, which is of questionable value and reality, becomes the benchmark for this line of work I think this might lead other follow-up work in the wrong direction.  I feel that this is a critical issue, and the paper will be much stronger after a more realistic task setting is added.

Thus, I am not recommending acceptance at this time, but would definitely like the authors to think hard and carefully about a good and realistic benchmark for the task, and follow up with a revised version of the paper in the future.

The paper proposes two constraints, transferring the knowledge from 2D domain to 3D domain and vice versa, to do weakly supervised semantic segmentation in 2D and 3D.  During inference the model doesn't require paired data.

The paper is clearly written, and explains how the 3D geometrical information complements the redundant dense 2D information.  The reviewers mention limited experiments.  However, the ablations are thorough, and show significant improvement over SotA performance.

 The novelty looks limited as the techniques are very similar to Hazan and Singh 2021 . In general I do not think the paper is well-written, as many notations are directly referred to without definition . The paper proposes boosting (using Frank-Wolfe) weak RL learners to get a strong (in a concrete sense) policy . The main theoretical bound does not depend on the number of states, which indicates that the method should be competitive in very large state-space MDPs .
Gold Metareview 253:
The paper proposes a boosting algorithm for RL based on online boosting. The main advantage of the result is that the sample complexity does not explicitly depend on number of states. Post rebuttal, some of the reviewers have changed their opinion on the paper. However, overall the reviewers still seem to be on the fence about this paper. Seems like the paper combines the techniques from Hazan Singh’21 along with a frank-wolfe algorithm to deal with non-convex sets but the reviewers seem to view this as not as significant a new contribution. 

I see the paper as being interesting but do agree with some of the comments of the reviewers and am leaning to a reject.

The paper presents an actor critic type of method consisting of two types of features -- dynamics and tasks, in the multi-task continuous control setting.

The concerns remain after the discussion period. 

In the next version of the manuscript, the authors are encouraged to pursue more difficult settings and modify the method to work on those problems. That would make the paper stronger, and lead to a more novel method evaluated on harder problems.

although the idea is a straightforward extension of the usual (flat) attention mechanism (which is positive), it does show some improvement in a series of experiments done in this submission. the reviewers however found the experimental results to be rather weak and believe that there may be other problems in which the proposed attention mechanism could be better utilized, despite the authors' effort at improving the result further during the rebuttal period. this may be due to a less-than-desirable form the initial submission was in, and when the new version with perhaps a new set of more convincing experiments is reviewed elsewhere, it may be received with a more positive attitude from the reviewers.

 A paper studies local asymptotic stability of a specific class of solutions points, referred to as strict local minmax equilibria .

It seems to me that the authors have not qualitatively improved over (Jin et al. 2020) (although I believe the bounds in this paper are tighter)
Gold Metareview 263:
This paper treats the problem of running gradient descent-ascent (GDA) in min-max games with a different step-size for the two players. Earlier work by Jin et al. has shown that, when the ratio of the step-sizes is large enough, the stable fixed points of GDA coincide with the game's strict local min-max equilibria. The main contribution of this paper is an explicit characterization of a threshold value $\tau^*$ of this ratio as the maximum eigenvalue of a specific matrix that involves the second derivatives of the game's min-max objective at each (strict local) equilibrium.

This paper generated a fairly intense discussion, and the reviewers showed extraordinary diligence in assessing the authors' work. Specifically, the reviewers raised a fair number of concerns concerning the initial write-up of the paper, but these concerns were mostly addressed by the authors in their revision and replies. As a result, all reviewers are now in favor of acceptance.

After my own reading of both versions of the paper and the corresponding discussion, I concur with the reviewers' view and I am recommending acceptance subject to the following revisions for the final version of the paper:
1. Follow the explicit recommendations of AnonReviewer3 regarding the numerical simulations (or, failing that, remove them altogether). [The authors' phrase that "The theory we provide also does not strictly apply to using RMSprop" does not suffice in this regard]
2. Avoid vague statements like $\tau \to \infty$ in the introduction regarding the work of Jin et al. and state precisely their contributions in this context. In the current version of the paper, a version of this is done in page 4, but the introduction is painting a different picture, so this discussion should be transferred there.
3. A persisting concern is that the authors' characterization of $\tau^*$ cannot inform a practical choice of step-size scaling (because the value of $\tau^*$ derived by the authors depends on quantities that cannot be known to the optimizer). Neither the reviewers nor myself were particularly convinced by the authors' reply on this point. However, this can also be seen as an "equilibrium refinement" result, i.e., for a given value of $\tau$ only certain equilibria can be stable. I believe this can be of interest to the community, even though the authors' characterization cannot directly inform the choice of $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ (or their ratio).

Modulo the above remarks (which the authors should incorporate in their paper), I am recommending acceptance.

Gold Metareview 266:
The paper provides a uniform generalization bound for overparameterized neural networks using the notion of maximal information gain. The analysis relies on the eigendecay of the eigenvalues of the NTK, which has recently been the object of a lot of work in the literature, including the work of Bietti and Bach (the proof actually uses one of their key lemma).

The paper originally received a set of reviews with a large disagreement between the reviewers (including two reviewers with a negative opinion and three reviewers being more positive). After the discussion period, two reviewers kept a very negative opinion, while other reviewers slightly lowered their score. Some of the problems raised by the reviewers include the restrictions imposed on the data, a missing proof (which was eventually added by the authors), the discussion of prior work being inadequate (including for instance the differences with more classical generalization bounds), and the novelty of the analysis.

Overall, the paper clearly has some merits but some of the concerns above are too important at this stage to accept the paper. I recommend the authors address the concerns mentioned in the reviews before re-submission.

Gold Metareview 269:
The authors study an inverse reinforcement learning problem where the goal is to infer an underlying reward function from demonstration with bias.  To achieve this, the authors learn the planners and the reward functions from demonstrations. As this is in general impossible, the authors consider two special cases in which either the reward function is observed on a subset of tasks or in which the observations are assumed to be close to optimal. They propose algorithms for both cases and evaluate these in basic experiments. The problem considered is important and challenging. One issue is that in order to make progress the authors need to make strong and restrictive assumptions (e.g., assumption 3, the well-suited inductive bias). It is not clear if the assumptions made are reasonable. Experimentally, it would be important to see how results change if the model for the planner changes and to evaluate what the inferred biases would be. Overall, there is consensus among the reviewers that the paper is interesting but not ready for publication.

Gold Metareview 270:
Four out of five reviewers recommend acceptance of the paper with a score of 7. These reviewers praise the quality and importance of the dataset. Moreover, all reviewers acknowledge the quality of the writing.

The authors have constructively engaged into the discussion with the reviewers, and have put a lot of effort into drastically improving their submission based on all reviewers' comments. The weaknesses raised by the reviewers have been successfully addressed.

In particular, the reviewer (dm8f) who gave a score of 4 raised the following concerns:

1. There exist other time series anomaly detection datasets.
2. More anomaly detection methods should be considered in the experiments. 
3. The finetune mode and distillation mode are not detailed, their pseudocodes should be provided.

The authors have addressed these concerns as follows:

1. In their answer, the authors went through an extensive list of existing benchmarks and justified why they are not appropriate to solve their focused problem, and how their dataset differ from those. The main added value of the proposed dataset is its timespan and the fact that its occurring distribution shifts are natural (as opposed to synthesized).
2. The authors have expanded their experiments with more anomaly detection models. The new results corroborate the previous conclusions.
3. The authors have added the pseudocode algorithm in Appendix and have added code to replicate their experiments in the git repository.

I believe that the authors have sufficiently addressed the reviewer's concerns (and more).

For these reasons, I recommend acceptance of the paper.

Generated Summary 271:
 The paper describes an adversarial training approach that, in addition to the commonly used robustness loss, requires the network to extract similar representation distributions for clean and attacked data . Authors claim that the proposed method outperforms other methods when the target domain is the adversarial examples . The experimental results are persuasive, however, the approach is too simple and not novel enough . The main idea is to treat the problem as a domain adaptation problem by considering the data shift between adversarial and clean distributions .
Gold Metareview 271:
The paper describes an adversarial training approach that, in addition to the commonly used robustness loss, requires the network to extract similar representation distributions for clean and attacked data. The proposed method is inspired by domain adaptation approaches that require a model to extract domain invariant/agnostic features from two domains. Although the experimental results are solid and technically sound, the novelty of the methodology is not enough, as the domain classifier and the gradient reversal layer are the same with those methods in domain adaptation such as "unsupervised domain adaptation by backpropagation". On the other hand, more recent SOTA methods are missing and only smaller scale datasets are used for evaluation. During the discussions, the major concerns from three reviewers are novelty. 

I totally agree that the simplicity of the method should be a virtue. However, the idea of domain-invariant representation learning is already established well, and its application to adversarial training is quite intuitive to the community. Also, the similar methodology already exists in domain adaptation. According to the top-tier conference culture in the ML community, what most valuable is the novelty and insight, not the performance. In the end, I think that this paper may not be ready for publication at ICLR, but the next version must be a strong paper.

Generated Summary 272:
 WPipe is a technique for reducing the memory overheads of weight versioning and improving freshness of weight updates in pipeline parallelism . It tackles an important problem of how to fit rapidly growing model sizes into slower growing device memory . WPipe divides model partitions into two groups and updates each group alternatively . This eliminates half of the delayed gradients and memory redundancy compared to Pipedream-2BW . The weakness include: The overall appears narrow and incremental in the sense that WPipes is fixing a memory efficiency bug .
Gold Metareview 272:
The paper proposes a new pipeline-parallel training method called WPipe. WPipe works (on a very high level) by replacing the two-buffer structure of PipeDream-2BW with a two-partition-group structure, allowing resources to be shared in a similar way to PipeDream-2BW but with less memory use and less delays in weight update propagation across stages. The 1.4x speedup it achieves over PipeDream-2BW is impressive.

In discussion, the reviewers agreed that the problem WPipe tries to tackle is important and that the approach is novel and interesting. But there was significant disagreement among the reviewers as to score. A reviewer expressed concern about the work being incremental and difficult to follow. And while these were valid concerns, and the authors should take note of them when revising their paper, I do not think they should present a bar to publication, both based on my own read of the work and also in light of the fact that other reviewers with higher confidence scores did not find novelty to be a disqualifying concern. As a result, I plan to follow the majority reviewer opinion and recommend acceptance here.

Generated Summary 273:
 This paper introduces four EEG signal transformations to model the real-world variability observable during deployment . It proposes a multi-pronged approach to evaluate the robustness of healthcare ML models . The novelty of the paper is weak, as it is adapted from an existing model . The authors motivate the need for better evaluation methods for medical deep learning models, especially methods that do a better job of predicting in-the-wild problems of a model .
Gold Metareview 273:
The paper introduces model-agnostic ways of quantifying predictive uncertainty and latent space differences in the situation when the distribution of data encountered during deployment differs from what the system was trained on and there is no access to the data itself. The model is evaluated on large scale EEG data.

The paper solves an important problem, in particular to the field of healthcare which has previously seen instances of models underperforming significantly at the time of deployment. As mentioned by the reviewers, this direction has not been sufficiently explored, so there is novelty in the problem itself, as well as in the solution. The experiments on EEG data were seen as convincing by the reviewers, though some questions were raised about the scope of the paper.

Overall, there is considerable merit in the work and recommend acceptance of this paper. In the camera ready, the authors should make sure not to overstate the applicability of their method. While this work could, in theory, be applied (or adapted) to other data, the merits of it outside of models trained on EEG data have not been demonstrated and should therefore not be stated as a given.

Reviewers x119 and PL6S have not engaged in the discussion although the authors responded to the issues they raised, which I kept in mind when issuing my recommendation.

 In this paper, the authors consider Byzantine-robustness of a distributed learning system in the setting of non-iid data distribution . The bucketing technique is applied to reduce the heterogeneity across the workers . The authors also claim that for the over-parametrized case, the negative impact of data heterogeneity can be eliminated . The paper is well-motivated, clearly written, and contains solid contributions . Overall, this paper has publication merits, but some issues need to be addressed .
Gold Metareview 274:
This manuscript proposes and analyses a bucketing method for Byzantine-robustness in non-iid federated learning. The manuscript shows how existing Byzantine-robust methods suffer vulnerabilities when the devices are non-iid, and describe a simple coordinated attack that defeats many existing defenses. In response, the primary algorithmic contribution is a bucketing approach that aggregates subgroups of devices before robust aggregation. This approach is also easily composed with existing Byzantine-robust methods. The manuscript includes an analysis of the performance of the proposed approach, including an information-theoretic lower bound for certain settings.

During the review, the main concerns are related to the clarity of the technical contributions, and unclear technical statements. The authors respond to these concerns and have satisfied the reviewers. After discussion, reviewers are generally strongly positive about the strength of the manuscript contributions. The authors are reminded to make the final changes agreed in the public discussion e.g., discussion of the reduction to SGD when  $\delta=0$

 Paper presents empirical analysis of multi-headed Self-Attention (MSA) as part of Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants . Paper proposes a new architecture -- AlterNet, where CNN block is combined with MSA block . AlterNet is shown to outperform pure CNNs in both large and small data regimes . It shows that contrary to popular belief ViTs do not benefit from their more expressive underlying representation, but instead smooth the loss landscape which aids training .
Gold Metareview 275:
The paper presents an empirical analysis of Vision Transformers - and in particular multi-headed self-attention - and ConvNets, with a focus on optimization-related properties (loss landscape, Hessian eigenvalues). The paper shows that both classes of models have their strengths and weaknesses and proposes a hybrid model that takes the best of both worlds and demonstrates good empirical performance.

Reviewers are mostly very positive about the paper. Main pro is that analysis is important and this paper does a thorough job at it and draws some useful insights. There are several smaller issues with the presentation and the details of the content, but the authors did a good job addressing these in their responses.

Overall, it's a good paper on an important topic and I recommend acceptance.

 This paper considers learning a model for reinforcement learning and proposes to also learn the gradients of the model in addition to just the predictions . The experimental results in Figure 1 show the sample efficiency and show an improvement over the relevant baselines, using 5 trials . The authors present a new approach for model-based reinforcement learning by training two models and using them separately . One model prioritizes accurate transitions and another has a weighting term for value-gradient . They combine in a new algorithm directional derivative projection policy optimization .
Gold Metareview 276:
The paper considers model-based RL, and focuses on approaches that benefit from the differentiability of the model in order to compute the policy gradient. It theoretically shows that the error in the gradient of the model w.r.t. its input appears in an upper bound of the error in the policy gradient computing using the learned model. Motivated by this, it suggests a MBRL approach that learns two models, one of them minimizes the next-state prediction error (as commonly done) and the other minimizes a combination of prediction error and the gradient error. 
The paper empirically studies the method through extensive experiments.

Reviewers are generally positive about this work. They believe that the paper is insightful and the method is original. At first, there were some important concerns raised by the reviewers, but the authors revised their paper in the discussion period, and it appears that the reviewers are all satisfied now. I also read the paper during the rebuttal phase, and I should say that I have some concerns myself, especially on the theory part of the paper. Given that the authors did not have an opportunity to answer my questions, I do not put much weight on my concerns (and I believe most of them can be addressed with some clarifications). Considering the positive response of reviewers and promising results, I am going to recommend **acceptance** of this paper.

I strongly encourage the authors to consider the comments by reviewers, as well as the following ones, in the revision of their paper.


**Comments**

1) The true dynamics $f$ is defined as a stochastic one, i.e., $s_{t+1} = f(s_t, a_t, \epsilon_t)$ (just before Eq. 1), and similarly for the learned model. Here $\epsilon_t$ is the noise causing the stochasticity of the model. But later, when the errors on the model and its gradient are introduced (i.e., $\epsilon_f$ and $\epsilon_f^g$), the role of stochasticity becomes unclear.
For example, we have
$\|| \tilde{f}(s,a) - f(s,a) \||  \leq \epsilon_f$.

What happened to the noise term?

The same is true for Eq. (5). The next-state s' (either according to the true dynamics or the learned model) is random. In that case, it is not obvious how to interpret Eq. (5). Is it the error of the expected gradient of the next state? Or is it something else?

In case the dynamics is assumed to be deterministic, this should be clarified early in the paper.

2) The upper bound in Theorem 1 might be vacuous if the Lipschitz constant $L_f$ of the model is larger than 1.
To see this, consider Lemma 1. The constant $C_0$ is $\min [D/\epsilon_f, (1-L_f^{t+1})/(1 - L_f)]$.
If $L_f$ is larger than 1, for large enough t, the term $(1-L_f^{t+1})/(1 - L_f)$ blows up and $C_0$ becomes $D/\epsilon_f$. Therefore, the upper bound of Lemma 1 becomes $D$. Here $D$ is the diameter of the state space, which is assumed to be bounded.

This carries to in the next lemmas. In Lemma 4, $C_5$ would be of the same order as $C_0$ (multiplied by an extra $L_1 L_f / (1 - \gamma) )$, so the upper bound of this lemma becomes proportional to D too.

The $C_0$'s appearance continues in the proof of Theorem 1, in which $C_8$ is proportional to $C_0$ and $C_5$. So, $C_8$ is also become proportional to $D/\epsilon_f$. When we have $C_8 \epsilon_f$ in Eq. (34), we get a constant term $D$.
A similar dependence appears in the proof of Theorem 2, where B_3 is proportional to $C_8 \epsilon_f$, which can be as large as $D$. And in Eq. (47), we have $B_3^2$. So the upper bound in Eq. (47), which seems to the be upper bound of Theorem 2, is proportional to $D^2$. This means that if $L_f$ is larger than one, the upper bound does not go to zero, no matter how small the model error $\epsilon_f$ is (unless it is actually zero). This makes the bound meaningless.

This might be unavoidable. I am not sure about it at the moment. But it definitely requires a discussion.

3) Assumption 2 has a term in the form of $E[\frac{s_{t_2}}{ s_{t_1}} ]$ (I have simplified the form). The states $s_{t_2}$ and $s_{t_1}$ are vectors in general. How is the division defined here?

4) Please improve the clarify of the proofs. For example, in Lemma 2 it seems that a negative sign is missing in Eq. (49). Also how do we get Eq. (50) and Eq. (52)? (I couldn't easily verify them).

5) I believe the "periodicity property" used in Assumption 1 should be "ergodicity property".

6) The paper still has a lot of typos, e.g., "To optimize the objective, One can ..." (P3), "argument data" (instead of augmented) (p4), "Superpose" (p5), "funcrion" (p6).

Dear Authors,

Thank you very much for your detailed feedback to the initial reviews and also for further answering additional questions raised by a reviewer. Your effort has been certainly contributed to clarifying some of the concerns raised by the reviewers and improving their understanding of this paper.

Overall, all the reviewers found a merit in this paper and thus I suggest its acceptance. However, as Reviewer #2 suggested, investigating the convergence in the stochastic case is very important. More discussion on this would be a valuable addition to the paper, which the authors can incorporate in the final version.

 The paper proposed a very interesting training algorithm for auto-regressive models . It does not require any MLE pre-training and can directly optimize from the sampling . The idea should also apply on many “incremental rewards”, for instance, BLEU scores in machine translation, etc. The authors conduct a number of experiments, and show that this scheme allows them to attain state-of-the-art performance on end-to-end speech recognition .

This paper proposes an algorithm for training sequence-to-sequence models from scratch to optimize edit distance. The algorithm, called optimal completion distillation (OCD), avoids the exposure bias problem inherent in maximum likelihood estimation training, is efficient and easily implemented, and does not have any tunable hyperparameters. Experiments on Librispeech and Wall Street Journal show that OCD improves test performance over both maximum likelihood and scheduled sampling, yielding state-of-the-art results. The primary concerns expressed by the reviewers pertained to the relationship of OCD to methods such as SEARN, DAgger, AggreVaTe, LOLS, and several other papers. The revision addresses the problem with a substantially larger number of references and discussion relating OCD to the previous work. Some issues of clarity were also well addressed by the revision.

 The paper is written, provides good description of the state-of-the-art and comprehensive results . It is for the expert audience mostly and is difficult to grasp without a good background on deep learning for speech enhancement . My major concern is that this paper is a little bit too specific to the speech enhancement applications . My suggestion is to describe some potential applications of this method to the other (speech) applications including speech separation, noise-robust front-end for ASR, TTS, or other speech analysis .
Gold Metareview 284:
The authors propose an algorithm for enhancing noisy speech by also accounting for the phase information. This is done by adapting UNets to handle features defined in the complex space, and by adapting the loss function to improve an appropriate evaluation metric.

Strengths
- Modifies existing techniques well to better suit the domain for which the algorithm is being proposed. Modifications like extending UNet to complex Unet to deal with phase, redefining the mask and loss are all interesting improvements.
- Extensive results and analysis.

Weaknesses
- The work is centered around speech enhancement, and hence has limited focus. 

Even though the paper is limited to speech enhancement, the reviewers agreed that the contributions made by the paper are significant and can help improve related applications like ASR. The paper is well written with interesting results and analysis. Therefore, it is recommended that the paper be accepted.

 The theoretical justification provided is basically heuristic argument and, speaking rigorously, is not a theorem . The practical applicability is very limited as the kernel obtained has very high computational complexity . This paper extends an argument for the GP behaviour of deep, infinitely-wide fully-connected networks to convolutional and residual deep neural networks . It provides a computationally tractable approach to compute the corresponding GP kernel . This kernel has few hyper-parameters and achieves state-of-the-art results on MNIST dataset .
Gold Metareview 286:
This paper builds on a promising line of literature developing connections between Gaussian processes and deep neural networks.  Viewing one model under the lens of (the infinite limit of) another can lead to neat new insights and algorithms.  In this case the authors develop a connection between convolutional networks and Gaussian processes with a particular kind of kernel.  The reviews were quite mixed with one champion and two just below borderline.

The reviewers all believed the paper had contributions which would be interesting to the community (such as R1: "the paper presents a novel efficient way to compute the convolutional kernel, which I believe has merits on its own" and R2: "I really like the idea of authors that kernels based on convolutional networks might be more practical compared to the ones based on fully connected networks").  All the reviewers found the contribution of the covariance function to be novel and exciting.

Some cited weaknesses of the paper were that the authors didn't analyze the uncertainty from the model (arguably the reasoning for adopting a Bayesian treatment), novelty in appealing to the central limit theorem to arrive at the connection, and scalability of the model.

In the review process it also became apparent that there was another paper with a substantially similar contribution.  The decision for this paper was calibrated accordingly with that work.

Weighing the strengths and weaknesses of the paper and taking into account a reviewer willing to champion the work it seems there is enough novel contribution and interest in the work to justify acceptance.

The authors provided responses to the reviewer concerns including calibration plots and timing experiments in the discussion period and it would be appreciated if these can be incorporated into the camera ready version.

 DaSGD is an algorithm for large-scale large-batch training of deep neural networks . The algorithm combines Local SGD with delayed averaging steps to hide the communication overhead . However, workers still synchronize their forward/backward passes in each iteration . The paper is well-written and easy to understand, but I have some concerns in the novelty . I believe the proposed method is not novel and [2] has proposed a very similar method .
Gold Metareview 287:
This paper proposes a variant of stochastic gradient descent that parallelizes the algorithm for distributed training via delayed gradient averaging. While the algorithm (DaSGD) proposed is sensible and seems to work, it also seems to miss a lot of related work. As pointed out by one of the reviewers, the class of asynchronous decentralized methods already seem to cover the space of DaSGD, and it's not clear how DaSGD differs from the existing methods in this space. As a result of this lack of comparison to related work, the reviewers recommended that the paper not be accepted at this time, and this evaluation was not challenged by an author response. I agree with this consensus.

This paper presents some new results on near-optimum algorithms for distributed optimization, nearly matching lower bounds. Most of the reviewers are positive about the contributions of this work. However, one issue that came up is the assumption of bounded gradient dissimilarity, which is essentially a gap between upper and lower bounds. While I am recommending to accept this paper, I believe this gap should be more prominently discussed in the abstract and introduction.

 The paper tackles the problem of controlled text generation by converting it into a conditional text generation similar to (Keskar et al.19) It proposes an architectural modification to the transformer LM used in GPT2 . A CoCon layer is added as a separate transformer block in the middle allowing self-attention to be performed between the textual context representations LM_α(c) and the generations LM_a(x_{:t-1) The novelty of the CoCon method lies in its ability to condition on entire input sequences .

The paper aims at controllable generation by introducing an additional "content-conditioner" block in the Transformer models. The paper further provides 4 different variants of a pre-training task to train the content-conditioner model. 

While the proposed approach seems an incremental contribution over CTRL and PPLM, certain reviews praised the approach being novel while keeping the architecture changes minimal. Overall, reviews indicate that the overall proposed method of fine-grained controlled generation with self-supervision is valuable, and empirical results support its effectiveness. 

All reviewers initially raised concerns regarding clarity and lack of human evaluation. However, clarity issues seem to be resolved through author/reviewer discussions and the updated revision.

R3 had important concerns regarding topic and sentiment relevance evaluations.  
While the reviewer remains unconvinced after discussions with authors, after carefully reading the revised paper and discussions, I feel that the authors tried to address this point fairly  through their additional experiments and also edited their contribution statement accordingly.

Overall, at least two reviewers sounded very excited about this work and other than R3's concerns, the general sentiment about this work was positive. Therefore, I recommend weak accept.  

There are still some writing issues that I strongly encourage authors to carefully address in the future versions. Quoting from reviewer discussions:

> Differentiability of the adversarial loss. Authors just added one statement saying " Through continuous approximation.." without any more details are given, which continuous approx was used (Gumbel softmax?) and how they overcame the problem of its training instability. 

> Table 6, can be misleading, authors bold the results when cocon+ is performing better than baselines (mostly in content similarity) but not the other way around topic/sentiment accuracy. The latter is arguably more important.

Gold Metareview 291:
The paper presents a multi-granularity input represenaion and a pyramid attention mechanism for code summarizaiton tasks. After extensive discussion, the reviewers still cannot agree on accepting or rejecting this paper. The key discussion points and my opinion are summarized in below. 


1. Performance improvement -- a few reviewers point out the performance improvement is relatively small (about 1%) compared with baseline. With the additional error bar provided by the authors, it seems to me the improvement is statistically significant. The authors also provide sufficient ablation study to justify the improvement. Although it's arguable if the proposed appracoh is substantial, the progress of AI is often driven by incremental improvement in terms of performance. Therefore, I'm less concerned by this issue. 

2. Comparison only on 1 language and 2 datasets. I partially agree with the authors and reviwers Xtyo that the paper already conducted extensive experiments and the merits of the proposed approach are justified. However, I disagree with the attritue that the comparison on 1 language is sufficient given the recent progress of code summariziton. As the proposed approach is mainly justified by empirical comparison, conducting results on a limited dataset raises the concern whether the proposed approach is generalizble to other languages and datasets. It also makes future work harder to compare with this work. I especially disagree the point that some earlier papers only compared on limited datasets. These papers are published earlier than the benchmark CodeXGlue has been released. As most recent baselines are compared on CodeXGlue, there is a need to justify the missing of results on this dataset. Besides, the argument of the dataet is noisy the performance is low do not seem rigorous and reasonable to me.

3. Human evaluation. The authors provide a preliminary study of human evaluation on the generated outputs. On one hand, it shows the proposed approach indeed improve the quality of the summary, but on the other hand, the study requires more rigorous design. I would suggest including the human evaluation on the main text rather than in appendix. 

4. Presentation. The paper is mostly well-written and provide nice intuition behind the propose method. However, I also agree with Q2Zz that some statements might overclaim and require justification. The later part of the paper has significant number of typos and require a careful proofread. It's pity that the authors do not take the opportunity during the rebuttal period to revise the paper.

Overall, I think the paper has sufficient merits but still have room to improve. 

Generated Summary 292:
 The authors propose a method that incorporates multi-way relationships between action dimensions in the estimate of action-value functions . This provides a strong inductive bias for reinforcement learning problems with a small number of action dimensions, each taking several values . This paper incorporates a concept called hypergraph network into reinforcement learning . The proposed action hypergraph networks outperform several existing baselines . The key impact of this architecture could be in the bandit problem setting .
Gold Metareview 292:
After reading the reviews and rebuttal and looking over the paper, I feel that the results are indeed strong, and the paper could have an impact in terms of exploiting the relationship among action dimensions. Maybe the only detail that I would add is that going through the example given in Fig 1 completely could be useful as it might not be perfectly obvious how (e.g. considering a simple mixing function like summation) one retrieves the q values for someone not familiar with this particular topic. 

Generated Summary 293:
 The paper is clearly organized and the logic flow is good . Authors adopt a task-agnostic U-net to model the retinal encoding process . They do this by reconstructing movie frames from neural responses . They analyze the latent representations and find that static features and dynamic features are encoded synergistically . Curiously, the latent representation can be used to accurately decode time in the movie, even for novel movies . This suggests that the model learns a low-dimensional representation of elapsed time .
Gold Metareview 293:
The authors analyze the latent representation of visual features from natural movies in the salamander retina using a U-net. They train an encoder to learn a compressed latent representation from a large population of salamander retinal ganglion cells responding to natural movies, while a decoder samples from this compressed latent space to generate the appropriate movie frame. They characterize its representation of “time in the natural scene” in the latent space of their model.

Overall, the reviewers expressed a lot of interest in the topic and valued the novel application to salamander retinal data. There were some questions about the significance of the finding, and through the rebuttal period, the authors provided a number of experiments to compare against other variants of their baselines (and ablations), with some reviewers increasing their scores in favor of acceptance. 

At the same time, there was concern that the U-Net architecture could potentially reconstruct the movie without any retinal data. Thus, it was not entirely clear whether the model was truly leveraging the retinal data to obtain meaningful outputs. Unfortunately, this concern was not fully addressed in the revision, leaving the reviewers overall with mixed views but the majority in favor of acceptance.

 This model is fundamental and useful. I believe there should be many applications. This work already experiments on many. I cannot find any clear weakness in this work . The organization of this paper could be improved. Text and figures arrangement can be better . At least a paragraph dedicated to how this method can solve societal or AI-related problems and can be applied can provide a lot of value . Good references to other research overall, but references missing at times, especially when referring to “prior methods” for forecasting in dynamic networks .

 The paper is concerned with selective classification in a stylised 'realisably noisy' data model . The proposed method has remarkably better selective classification compared to the classification literature . The paper mostly reads well, has detailed theoretical analysis, and presents experimental evidence supporting the claims . The theory of the paper---though highly stylized and is based on $0-1$ loss that cannot be optimized efficiently---is revealing and also a good starting point .

This paper studies a learning scenario in which there exist 2 classes of examples: "predictable" and "noise". Learning theory is provided for this setting and a novel algorithm is devised that identifies predictable examples and makes predictions at the same time. A more practical algorithm is devised as well. Results are supported by experiments.

Reviewers have raised a number of concerns (ranging from how realistic this settings is to missing references). Overall they found this work interesting and relevant to ML community and appreciate the effort that authors have put in in their thoughtful response. However, after a thorough deliberation conference program committee decided that the paper is not sufficiently strong in its current form to be accepted.

Generated Summary 297:
 This paper proposes a way to define f-divergences for densities which may have different supports . While the idea itself is interesting and can be potentially very impactful, I feel the paper itself needs quite a bit of work before being accepted to a top venue . The paper seems hastily written, with some grammar issues, typos, and sloppy use of LaTeX . It also forgets some potential drawbacks of the technique, including the fact that variance increases .
Gold Metareview 297:
This manuscript proposes spread divergences as a technique for extending f-divergences to distributions with different supports. This is achieved by convolving with a noise distribution. This is an important topic worth further study in the community, particularly as it related to training generative models.

The reviewers and AC opinions were mixed, with reviewers either being unconvinced about the novelty of the proposed work, or expressing issues about the clarity of the presentation. Further improvement of the clarity, combined with additional convincing experiments would significantly strengthen this submission.

Generated Summary 298:
 The paper is deserving of acceptance to ICLR 2021 . The authors develop a Transformer model for language-agnostic code summarization . They demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on this task when testing against comparable architectures and datasets . This paper wants to combine sequence (called Context) and AST (called Structure) representations of source code . For this, it makes clever use of relative position embedding of Transformer-XL . Different pairwise relations based on ASTs and sequence ordering are computed and encoded as separate distance matrix .
Gold Metareview 298:
The paper gives an extension of the transformer model that is suited to computing representations of source code. The main difference from transformers is that the model takes in a program's abstract syntax tree (AST) in addition to its sequence representation, and utilizes several pairwise distance measures between AST nodes in the self-attention operation. The model is evaluated on the task of code summarization for 5 different languages and shown to beat two state-of-the-art models. One interesting observation is that a model trained on data from all languages outperforms the monolingual version of the model.

The reviewers generally liked the paper. The technical idea is simple, but the evaluation is substantial and makes a convincing case about setting a new state of the art. The observation about multilingual models is also interesting. While there were a few concerns, many of these were addressed in the authors' responses, and the ones that remain seem minor. Given this, I am recommending acceptance as a poster. Please incorporate the reviewers' comments in the final version.

 This paper establishes generalization bounds for a broad class of losses over linear predictors by utilizing Moreau envelope theory . Strengths: The main results in the paper are novel due to their generality . Weaknesses: Some of the assumptions are not transparent and seem to be difficult to verify . Some assumptions may not be transparent and some of them seem to not be able to be verified . The paper studies the generalization properties of high-dimensional generalized linear models .
Gold Metareview 300:
The manuscript proves a new (finite-sample) generalization bound for generalized linear models, using Moreau envelope theory. The paper also provides experimental validation.

While the results only hold for Gaussian data, I believe there is some interesting novel results which might inspire some future work in the learning theory community. (In comparison, several novel frameworks have been created in the past for other problems, in which the initial versions assumed Gaussianity, e.g., the work on support recovery on sparse linear regression, for instance.)

Several technical clarifications regarding the assumptions (e.g., surrogate distribution, comparison to prior results) were asked by the reviewers, which the authors thoroughly and successfully addressed during the rebuttal phase. I recommend adding this to the camera-ready version of the paper, as well as other discussions and clarifications raised by all the reviewers.

 Heteogeneously Observable Imitation Learning (HOIL) is a variant of imitation learning in which the demonstrator and imitator have different observation spaces . The proposed method is a form of GAIL that uses importance sampling to reweight the . demonstrator/novice observations from data source . The authors conduct experiments on Mujoco and Atari games and their method gets the best imitation performance . Strengths are that the method is novel and performs well across many different environments .
Gold Metareview 301:
In this paper, the authors tackle the problem of demonstrators and learners having different observation spaces, by proposing an importance-weighted learning algorithm to bring the support of the imitator state marginal closer to that of the expert demonstrator's state marginal. 

All reviewers have voted to weak accept, but it would seem that this year's NeurIPS mechanism of reviewer assignment has resulted in a much higher acceptance rate than typical, with 80%+ of the AC batch having accept votes. As such, I am tasked with the tough job of rejecting some papers that reviewers were only lukewarmly excited about. It pains me to do this to a paper that reviewers have found methodologically correct. I will be recommending this paper be rejected based on calibration against other papers I'm AC'ing, mostly for the following reason:

The HOIL paper assumes a problem setting where:

1. expert observations with more privilege observations than learner: 
2. access to expert observations being high cost and invasive 
3. importance-weighting the data to close the support between learner and expert state distributions mitigates (1) and (2)

However, it's not demonstrated that (1) and (2) is an actual problem in practical applications. Is sensor mismatch between human and autonomous vehicles the actual problem for learning? Do self-driving cars even utilize a policy formulation explored in the HOIL paper? How big are these state / support mismatches in practice, and couldn't they be mitigated by simpler methods? This paper is the first I've heard suggested that sensor mismatch between humans and autonomous vehicle sensors is the bottleneck for performance. If we remove this motivation from the paper and only consider the importance weighting algorithm used for removing out of distribution examples, then it doesn't feel quite as novel as there are many works that propose some kind of distribution-projection step as a way to mitigate state marginal differences between teachers and learners (e.g. CQL). 

In fact, the setting (1) is not only avoided, but actively exploited by some learning papers (Asymmetric Actor Critic, Guided Policy Search, and other ideas) to *boost* the sample efficiency of learning, with the idea that the asymmetry in state support allows experts to provide useful learning signal in a way that the learner cannot adversarially overfit easily. 

From reviewer pD56, 
```
I didn't find the authors' response to be particularly convincing (the self-driving example doesn't seem like a good fit for what they're doing, and I think they're conflating differences in perceptual accuracy with differences in sensing hardware).

The reviewers are in agreement that this is a well-motivated paper and should be accepted. As R1 mentioned, the contribution does not lie in a novel visualization but rather in the process, insights, and patterns learned during the design and evaluation process. 

The reviewers also agreed that the design implications section lacked depth. This is the one area where the paper has the biggest scope of improving. The reviewers have offered suggestions for different approaches to addressing this shortcoming. 

Some other comments worth highlighting:
R1 has raised some concerns regarding how the 5 questions were selection and would like added details regarding the process. 
R2 would like some discussion around the prior approach or set-up that this system replaced. 
R3 has provided detailed feedback on minor changes which will improve the overall readability of the paper and can be accomplished prior to the camera ready submission.

This paper proposes a latent variable approach to the neural module networks of Andreas et al, whereby the program determining the structure of a module network is a structured discrete latent variable. The authors explore inference mechanisms over such programs and evaluate them on SHAPES.

This paper may seem acceptable on the basis of its scores, but R1 (in particular) and R3 did a shambolic job of reviewing: their reviews are extremely short, and offer no substance to justify their scores. R2 has admirably engaged in discussion and upped their score to 6, but continue to find the paper fairly borderline, as do I. Weighing the reviews by the confidence I have in the reviewers based on their engagement, I would have to concur with R2 that this paper is very borderline. I like the core idea, but agree that the presentation of the inference techniques for V-NMN is complex and its presentation could stand to be significantly improved. I appreciate that the authors have made some updates on the basis of R2's feedback, but unfortunately due to the competitive nature of this year's ICLR and the number of acceptable paper, I cannot fully recommend acceptance at this time.

As a complete side note, it is surprising not to see the Kingma & Welling (2013) VAE paper cited here, given the topic.

 This paper provides an empirical study of binary weight networks (BWNs) The authors find that the commonly adopted scaling factor is not critical . They find that there exists a subnetwork that stabiles early in training . The idea that weights with large norms are stable and sensitive on sign changes can be utilized for improving the training of BWNs .

Gold Metareview 305:
## Description
The paper discovers interesting phenomena in training neural networks with binary weights:
- Connection between latent weight magnitude and how important its binarized version for the network performance
-training dynamics, indicating that large latent weights are identified and stabilize early on
- Observation that amongst learned binary kernel, several specific patterns prevail, up to the bits who's reversal has very little effect. This is so regardless of the architecture, the layer considered or the dataset. 
The paper further demonstrates how these observations may be used to compress binary neural networks below 1 bit per weight.

## Review Process and Decision
The reviewers welcomed the experimental investigation of new phenomena, but commented the overall technical quality of the work as somewhat substandard. The redundancy of consecutive affine transforms is known and not connected to binary weights investigation. The investigation itself lacks a more in-depth analysis. The proposed compression results appeared not convincing to reviewers since a significant drop of accuracy occurs. The AC shares these concerns and supports rejection.

## General Comments
From my perspective, the study undertaken is methodologically „wrong“. An ad-hoc training method is investigated, which is not even clearly defined in the paper (there are many „STE“ variants) and for which it is not known what it is doing, what are the real-valued weights for and whether they are needed at all (as empirically argued by Helwegen et al. (2019)). As such, the investigation makes impression of poking a black box (the training method in this case). At the same time, there are more clear learning formulations, applicable in the setting of the paper (binary weights), in particular considering the stochastic relaxation:
* Shayer et al. (2017): Learning Discrete Weights Using the Local Reparameterization Trick
* Roth et al. (2019): Training Discrete-Valued Neural Networks with Sign Activations Using Weight Distributions
* Peters et al. (2018): Probabilistic binary neural networks

These methods are approximate, but at least the optimization is well posed and it is known what do the real-valued weights represent (e.g. logits of binary weight probabilities).
From this perspective, it can be seen that latent weights close to 0 correspond to Bernoulli weights that are almost fully random (and thus only contribute noise) and are fragile to gradient steps. Therefore the model can only perform well if it learns to be robust to their state or their state becomes more deterministic (corresponding to large latent weight). So one would actually expect to see in these models phenomena similar to the observed in the paper and not bee too much surprised or astonished by them. Furthermore, there are recent works explaining STE and its latent weights as optimizing the stochastic relaxation:
* Meng et al. (2020): Training Binary Neural Networks using the Bayesian Learning Rule
* Yanush et al. (2020): Reintroducing Straight-Through Estimators as Principled Methods for Stochastic Binary Networks. 

The authors are encouraged to make the observed phenomena more explainable by connecting to the mentioned works.

## Further Details

*  „We show that in the context of using batch normalization after convolutional layers, adapting scaling factors with either hand-crafted or learnable methods brings marginal or no accuracy gain to final model.“

From theoretical perspective, this is obvious and known to me. Practically, there could be in principle some difference due to the learning dynamics, and verifying that there is none is a useful but a weak contribution. The section devoted to this issue can be given in the appendix but is not justified in the main paper.

* „change of weight signs is crucial in the training of BWNs“

The sign determines the binary weights, so this is by definition.

* „ Firstly, the training of BWNs demonstrates the process of seeking primary binary sub-networks whose weight signs are determined and fixed at the early training stage, which is akin to recent findings on the lottery ticket hypothesis for efficient learning of sparse neural networks“

In the lottery ticket hypothesis paper it is shown explicitly that the identified sparse subnetwork changes during the learning the most rather than retains its initialization state or the state in the beginning of the training. It is therefore could be of a different nature.

Gold Metareview 306:
This paper demonstrates that deep networks can memorize adversarial examples of training data with completely random labels, which motivates some analyses on the convergence and generalization of adversarial training (AT). The authors identify a significant drawback of memorization in AT that could result in robust overfitting and propose a new algorithm to mitigate this drawback. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. One of the reviewers is concerned about (1) the validity of stability analysis where 80% of the data labels are noisy, and the perturbation (64/255) is large, (2) the gap between theory and practice, and (3) novelty. The authors have made a great effort to address these concerns. Although there is still no consensus after the author's response, the majority of the reviewers are in strong support. I, therefore, recommend acceptance.

 This paper proposes a method to train high- and low-level controllers to tackle hierarchical RL . The novelty is framing the problem of training a diverse set of LL controllers such that they can be used by a HL controller to solve high-level tasks . By dividing state representation into proprioceptive and task-specific, the reward used to train LL and HL controllers are simplified . The authors provide a reasonable explanation of their "periodicity" ideas, together with evidence that it can be beneficial, but is not always essential to the algorithm .
Gold Metareview 308:
Strengths 

The paper presents a method of training two-level hierarchies that is based on relatively intuitive ideas and that performs well.
The challenges of hierarchical RL makes this an important problem. The benefits of periodicity and the
separation of internal state from external state is a clean principle that can potentially be broadly employed. 
The method does well in outperforming the alternative baselines.

Weaknesses

There is no video of the results. There is related work, i.e., [Peng et al. 2016] (rev 4) uses 
a policy ensemble;  phase info is used in DeepLoco/DeepMimic; methods such as "Virtual Windup Toys for Animation" 
exploited periodicity (25y ago);  More comparisons with prior work such as Florensa et al. would help. 
The separation of internal and external state is an assumption that may not hold in many cases.
The results are locomotion focussed. There are only two timescales.

Decision

The reviewers are largely in agreement to accept the paper. 
There are fairly-simple-but-useful lessons to be found in the paper
for those working on HRL problems, particularly those for movement and locomotion. 
The AC sees the novely with respect to different pieces of related work is the weakest point of the paper.  
The reviews contain good suggestions for revisions and improvements;  the latest version may take care
of these (uploaded after the last reviewer comments). Overall, the paper will make a good contribution
to ICLR 2019.

 This work proposes a novel DIMES framework (stands for differentiable meta solver) to tackle large-scale learning-based combinatorial optimization problems . The key novelties and contributions are an RL-based approach to train the widely-used GCN model to generate a heatmap, and a meta-learning approach to finetune the solutions at inference . This approach seeks to provide more scalable CO solvers as solutions can be efficiently sampled from a generated heatmap with minimal additional overhead .
Gold Metareview 309:
This paper proposes a differentiable meta-solver applicable to large-scale combinatorial optimization. After a thorough discussion phase, all the reviewers are on the positive side of this paper. The reviewers appreciated the novelty of this paper and the importance of scaling neural combinatorial optimization for large-scale instances. Overall, I recommend acceptance for this paper.

However, the reviewers also showed concerns about the presentation of this paper. The gap between generalization and testing performance is not clearly discussed and the connection to prior works using continuous latent space should be clearly stated. Since scalability is an important issue, it would be useful to clear up time/objective comparison and unify experimental settings as suggested by Reviewer fQdp and fe3B.

 This paper proposes a framework to obtain the disentanglement of syntactic roles as latent variables for sentence representations . Strengths: Learning the syntactic disentangle in an unsupervised way . Weakness: The paper is hard to follow . The paper proposed a probabilistic model called Attention-Driven Variational Autoencoder (ADVAE) This model is another instance of $beta-VAE whose encoder and encoders are composed of Transformers .
Gold Metareview 311:
This paper proposes improving human interpretability and manipulability of neural representations by obtaining syntactic roles (here, subject, object, prepositional object, and main verb) without supervision by means of them becoming linked to latent variables in a novel proposed attention-driven VAE (ADVAE) model, which provides cross attention between a language transformer and latent variables. The paper argues that syntactic roles are quite central to meaning interpretation and that the ADVAE recovers them better than LSTM or Transformer (with mean pooling) VAEs.

This is a quite interesting direction and paper. There was active discussion with the reviewers, one of whom (9pDc) moved their rating from reject to quite strong support, while the other reviewers either sat on the fence or raised from reject to borderline. Nevertheless, I overall tend to agree that the paper is still lacking in empirical support, a view clearly shared by reviewers WuPD and 7uFL. The SNLI data is very simple descriptive sentences, nearly all in the form of S V O or S V PP. Would this work on more complex data, in other languages, or with more word order variation? There isn't very much investigation, but the new results added during reviewing based on Yelp data seem to offer more concerns than confidence. These are also very short sentences but with more varied structure and some complementation. It seems like D_{dec} is now very low (much lower than for the sequence VAE), the ability to distinguish out grammatical roles seems limited to {subj} vs. {dobj, pobj} in the encoder and none at all in the decoder (Figure 6/7). And then for the examples in Appendix D, the disentanglement abilities barely seem stronger than being able to pick out subjects, though when there are sentences with subordinate clauses, it is perhaps random which subject you get. The resampled realizations in appendix H also seem to show limited disentanglement: resampling the subject usually seems to change the object as well, often markedly. No convincing downstream applications are shown. As such, while I agree that disentanglement is at the heart of representation learning, I can't get on board with reviewer 9pDc feeling that this paper now has convincing results. Reviewer 7uFL also emphasizes that there is no strong reason that the latent variables have to align with syntactic roles. In particular, the motivation in NMT whereby constituents clump and reorder together does not exist here. It may only work for the very simple and regular sentences of SNLI.

Hence, overall, I feel that this method needs more extensive validation on harder, more varied data sets before it becomes a convincing contribution, and so I propose rejecting the paper at this point in time. Nevertheless, I do think the topic is interesting and this approach has the potential to be good.

Gold Metareview 312:
This paper introduces a prompting technique for eliciting factual knowledge from frozen pretained transformer LMs. The key idea is to modify the embeddings produced by the embedding layer before they are passed to the first attention layer and the paper investigates several different design choices. The Reviewers all agree that the paper tackles an important problem with interesting methods, that it is well written and has strong results. The main concerns, raised by Reviewer jddf, were about clarifying the connections to the robust optimization literature and evaluating on OOD relations. The former has been addressed in the revised version. While the latter point remains valid, I find that the paper in its current state has enough useful experiments and analysis to warrant publication. The authors have clarified most of the other points raised by the reviewers in their rebuttal.

The paper studies the behavior cloning based strategies of offline RL algorithms in different type of environments and reports that performance primarily depends on model size and regularization. The results contradict some of the earlier claims, and the authors conjecture that model size and regularization characteristics can explain past results.  

During the review period, the reviewers agreed that the paper has certain merits, and on the other hand, they also raised some concerns, regarding some missing technical details, whether the empirical finding could be trusted, the generalization of the findings to more scenarios, and the comparison with some highly related papers. The authors did a good job in their rebuttal, which removed many of the above concerns (although not all) and convinced the reviewers to raise their scores. As a result, we believe it is fine to accept the paper (although somehow like a weak accept).

Gold Metareview 314:
This paper considers the problem of online reinforcement learning in two-player zero-sum Markov games. They consider a class of Markov games called kernel mixture Markov games, which extend the linear mixture MDP setting considered in prior work to the RKHS setting.

The authors also provide an improved variant of the algorithm based on Bernstein-type confidence bonuses.

The reviewers found the setting to be important and found the paper to be well-written, and agreed that the main results are technically challenging and likely to be a useful starting point for future work on learning Markov games with function approximation. The main issue raised by the reviewers is that the algorithm design and analysis appears to be based on a combination of well-known existing techniques for simpler settings---for the final revision, the paper can be strengthened by more strongly advocating for the novelty required in combining these techniques.

Most reviewers were positive about the paper, seeing that the proposed method is practical and has convincing experimental performances. One reviewer was a bit negative and raised questions about clarity. After the authors responded, the negative reviewer didn't respond further.

 In this paper, the authors studied information-theoretic lower bounds of posterior contraction rate for Gaussian process regression with compositional assumptions . A sharper lower bound is also studied, showing that the performance under the Gaussian wavelet series priors suffers from the curse of dimensionality . The contraction rate is worse than the minimax estimation rate of deep GP . This is a purely theoretical work and there is no empirical study . The authors have not discussed negative societal impact of their work .
Gold Metareview 317:
The reviewers unanimously agree that the theory here exhibiting a particular case where Gaussian process priors are inferior to deep Gaussian processes is interesting, and furthermore that the proof techniques themselves are novel. Indeed, reviewers had minimal or no substantial concerns about the paper, and most of the questions asked by reviewers txpX and sPbe read as simple follow up questions that the authors may choose to include discussion on.

 This paper studies a variant of the indivisible item allocation problem . The motivation of this model is that, in a company or a department, workers many need to work in pairs . The paper considers a new variant of fair resource allocation problem: given a set of resources as vertices of a graph, the goal is to partition the resources among N agents . An agent utility is given by the maximum matching on the induced subgraph of his partition . The work also gives some hardness results and better approximation in certain special cases .

 Authors develop an algorithmic framework, DATASIFTER, for general robustness to bad training data . Proposed method is based on a set learning phase where the task is the following: Given a training set, the aim is to learn how an underlying model when trained on that training set will generalize to unseen data . The proposed methodology relies on utility metrics displaying "'approximate" submodularity . The paper is well-written and easy to follow .

The paper considers the question of identifying bad data so that models can be trained on the subset of data that is good. This question is formulated as a utility optimization problem. The paper shows that some popular heuristics are quite bad in the framework they propose. They also propose a new algorithmic framework called DataSifter. There is empirical evaluation provided for this. Questions have been raised in the reviews about the size of the models that have been used in the empirical evaluation. The authors have responded to this by suggesting the use of proxy model techniques. There are also questions about learnability of data utility for which some responses are provided in the rebuttal.

This paper presents a new task and model for predicting the hierarchical structure of organizations / institutes. The model predicts is-ancestor relationships between the institutions by modeling the set operations between the strings. The authors develop a new dataset, automatically derived from GRID, and compare their set-based model against a few baseline approaches. 

The reviewers’ comments were generally positive and praised the usefulness of the task, which makes us recommend acceptance. However, there were some concerns about the experimental setup (choice of baselines and evaluation).   We strongly recommend improving these aspects on the final version, as per the reviewers’ suggestions.

 This submission focuses on the cold start problem of new entities . It combines strengths of a new entity and content features of the new entity . The proposed method outperforms several intuitive naïve strategies as well as MAML strategies . The CHN uses a combination of a context vector and a meta vector (generated through a neural network from the new features's meta data) to produce parameters .

Gold Metareview 322:
This work presents a straightforward and easy to understand method for using hypernetworks to adapt existing models to be able to increase their output space. The method itself is also interesting and is detailed enough for reproducibility. However, the experiments and results should be improved by expanding the demonstration of CHNs beyond the narrow P-VAE application and comparing against relevant baselines in the recommendation system literature.

Pros
- Clear writing.
- Detailed hyperparameters to aid reproducibility.
- Straightforward model.

Cons
- Lack of sufficient comparison to related work, especially to existing recommendation systems that handle the cold-start issue and to Vartak, 2017.
- Limited results that only demonstrate application to P-VAE meaning it's still unknown if CHNs work well with other models. The result on the synthetic dataset is also less persuasive.
- Lack of sufficient ablations, i.e. training a SVM/linear regression model until convergence.

 In this paper, the authors apply a line-search of the step-size parameter of DGS (Zhang et al., 2020) to reduce tunning . Twelve synthetic functions and two practical problems are evaluated . The contribution is too marginal . It is not clear how much improvement the adaptive component makes vs. DGS . The default target precision is quite bad: L_{_{max} / 200, or 0.5% of the diameter of the space .
Gold Metareview 323:
The main goal of this paper is to develop a new adaptive strategy to remove the need of hyperparameter fine tuning, which hinders the performance of DGS (Zhang et al., 2020) method. This paper applies a line-search of the step-size parameter of DGS  to reduce tuning.  A heuristic update rule of the smooth parameter in DGS (Zhang et al., 2020)) is also used. 

Pros
+ The topic of learning hyperparameters on the fly is well-motivated and an important direction to improve many existing methods.
+ A wide range of tasks are considered in the experiments are interesting, with a wide range of tasks considered. 


Cons
- Reviewers have found the contribution to be incremental and marginal. Specifically, the reviewers have expressed concerns on the impact of the work since it verifies improvement upon DGS only. The paper could be stronger by showing evidence of improving other algorithms. 
-  In the work of [Zhang et. al., 2020], there are two parameters that require careful selection - the learning rate and smoothing radius. However, the proposed approach still relies on some hyperparameters. Although the authors claim that the method is not sensitive to these hyperparameters, it could be better justified. 
- The initial version lacks evaluation of the adaptive mechanism, although the authors added the comparison in the revised version. 
- The paper could be further improved by comparing against other hyperparameter optimization methods. 

We acknowledge the detailed response and the modifications of the manuscript. We believe the paper will make a more profound contribution and impact after addressing some of the major concerns raised by the reviewers.

The paper proposes a new algorithm for dataset distillation, based on two key ideas:  (1) train a linear layer given the fixed feature extractor, and (2) use a diverse set of modes as feature extractors. The paper has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Many reviewers find the algorithm effective, the paper well-written, and the results compelling. The rebuttal further addressed the concerns regarding the backbone models and missing experiments as well as provided additional clarifications.

 This work targets the problem of Continual Learning (CL) and In particular, the problem is populating the buffer memory in the Experience Replay (ER)-based paradigm . In ER, we are allowed to store a small subset of the incoming data stream, therefore deciding on a good policy to populate the memory buffer is important . The paper proposes MEMORABLE INFORMATION CRITERION (MIC) which is a combination of the . learnability of an incoming example and motivates this with a bayesian analysis . Using MIC, it introduces two algorithms, namely, InfoRS and infoGS for buffer update .
Gold Metareview 327:
One way of avoiding catastrophic forgetting in continual learning is through keeping a memory buffer for experience replay.  This paper addresses the problem of online selection of representative samples for populating such memory buffer for experience replay.  The paper proposes novel information-theoretic criteria that selects samples that captures surprise (samples that are most informative) and learnability (to avoid outliers).  They utilize a Bayesian formulation to quantify informativeness. They provide two algorithms: a greedy approach, and an approach that takes timing (when to) update memory into account based on reservoir sampling to mitigate possible issues with class imbalance.

Pros:  The paper is well written and organized.  It was easy to follow. The formulation is novel and technically sound. The idea of taking learnability into account is novel and interesting.  It provides a nice way of avoiding outliers and balancing surprising information. The authors presented the motivation for each part of the framework well.  

Cons: To understand the contribution of each component of the formulation and competing criteria, an ablation study is needed.
Reviewers had several detailed suggestions and questions, including sensitivity to hyperparameters, additional citations, additional data sets beyond MNIST and CIFAR10, etc.

As pointed out by the reviewers, the theoretical contributions of this paper are subsumed by a number of prior works (which were not initially cited). The experimental results of the paper are interesting. However, the method proposed  and evaluated is not particularly novel.

The submission received split reviews: two reviewers recommended weak accepts, and the other two weak rejects.  The AC went through the reviews, responses, and discussions carefully.  The AC agrees that this paper is well-written and has demonstrated the possibility of using transformers for particle-based physical simulation.  The AC also believes that the authors have addressed the concerns of reviewer dYcg, despite that the reviewer didn't engage in the discussions.  The contributions are however not most exciting, and none of the reviewers would like to champion the submission.

Further, the AC agrees with the knowledgeable and responsible reviewer ZsKn that the presentation and experiments can be better positioned to highlight the key contribution. As reviewer ZsKn has summarized, it's recommended that "the authors took the approach of integrating the different parts of the newly proposed layer into existing architectures (possibly including non-simulation settings), and try to understand better that way how the new layer may help in a more apples-to-apples comparison."

Gold Metareview 338:
### Paper summary 
This paper investigates theoretically and empirically the effect of increasing the number of parameters ("overparameterization") in GAN training. By analogy to what happens in supervised learning with neural networks, overparameterization does help to stabilize the training dynamics (and improve performance empirically). This paper provides an explicit threshold for the width of a 1-layer ReLU network generator so that gradient-ascent training with a linear discriminator yields a linear rate of convergence to the global saddle point (which corresponds to the empirical mean of the generator matching the mean of the data). The authors also provides a more general theorem that generalizes this result to deeper networks.

### Evaluation
The reviewers had several questions and concerns which were well addressed in the rebuttal and following discussion, in particular in terms of clarifying the meaning of "overparameterization". After discussing the paper, R1, R2 and R4 recommend acceptance while R3 recommends rejection. The main concern of R3 is that the GAN formulation analyzed in the paper is mainly doing moment matching between the generator  distribution (produced from a *fixed* set of latent variables z_i) and the empirical mean of the data. R3 argues that this is not sufficient to "understanding the training of GANs". At least two aspects are missing: how the distribution induced by the generator converges according to other notion of divergence (like KL, Wasserstein, etc.); and what about the true generator distribution (not just its empirical version from a fixed finite set of samples z_i)? While agreeing these are problematic, the other reviewers judged that the manuscript was useful first step in understanding the role of overparameterization in GANs and thus still recommend acceptance. And importantly, this paper is the first to study this question theoretically.

I also read the paper in more details. I have a feeling that some aspects of this work were already developed in the supervised learning literature; but the gradient descent-ascent dynamic aspect appears novel to me and the important question of the role of overparameterization here is both timely, novel and quite interesting. I side with R1, R2 and R4: this paper is an interesting first step, and thus I recommend acceptance. See below for additional comments to be taken in consideration for the camera ready version.

### Some detailed comments
- Beginning of section 2.3: please be clearer early on that you will keep V fixed to a random initialization rather than learning it. The fact that this is standard in some other papers is not a reason to not be clear about it.
- Theorem 2.2: in the closed form of the objective when $d$ is explicitly optimized, we are back to a more standard supervised learning formulation, for example (5) could look like regression. The authors should be more clear about this, and also mention in the main text that the core technical part used to prove Theorem 2.2 is from Oymak & Soltanolkotabi 2020 (which considers supervised learning). This should also a bit more clear in the introduction -- it seems to me that the main novelty of the work is to look at the gradient-descent dynamic, which is a bit different than the supervised learning setup, even though some parts are quite related (like the full maximization with respect to $d$).
- p.6 equation (8): typo -- the  $-\mu d_t$ term is redundant and should be removed as already included from $\nabla_d h(d,\theta)$.
- p.7 "numerical validations" paragraph: Please describe more clearly what is the meaning of "final MSE". Is this a global saddle point (and thus shows the limit of the generator to match the empirical mean), or is this coming from slowness of convergence of the method (e.g. after a fixed number of iterations, or according to some stopping criterion?). Please clarify.

 The paper proposes deep learning extension of the classic paradigm of 'conformal prediction' Conformal predictions is similar to multi-label classification, but with a statistical sound way of thresholding each (class-specific) classifier . The authors seem to be the first to attempt multiclass classification . They effectively build an independent classifier for each class that estimates whether an example comes from that class within a certain confidence set before training time . The paper claims such a method produces cautious classifiers that can produce "I don't know" answers .

The paper presents a conformal prediction approach to supervised classification, with the goal of reducing the overconfidence of standard soft-max learning techniques. The proposal is based on previously published methods, which are extended for use with deep learning predictors. Empirical evaluation suggests the proposal results in competitive performance. This work seems to be timely, and the topic is of interest to the community.

The reviewers and AC opinions were mixed, with reviewers either being unconvinced about the novelty of the proposed work or expressing issues about the strength of the empirical evidence supporting the claims. Additional experiments would significantly strengthen this submission.

Reviewers demand experimental comparisons with other (simpler) denoising / regularization techniques; more in depth experimental validation and analysis of the state-denoising behaviour; as well as experiments on larger datasets and more ambitious tasks.

 The biggest strength of the paper is clearly the development of a large-scale polyp pathology dataset with object-level boundingbox, segmentation annotations, and pathology labels . The actual improvements of the proposed approach over other classification techniques is very small, outperforming by 0.61% on classification accuracy . The architecture bases on the body of ResNet-50 and the head of FCOS . Using attention mechanism, the architecture removes the setting of priors, that is, anchors . The predicted attention mask can be useful for pathological classification .

 Authors present novel 2-stage technique to improve classification accuracy of feedforward ANNs . After the feedforward pass, a so-called introspective stage occurs, the goal of which is to ascertain why the particular class label was provided rather than a different label . This stage tends to improve the accuracy of the class predictions . The introspective networks have better generalization to distributional shifts and smaller calibration errors . Results on CIFAR10-Corrupted are very promising, and the method is able to improve in active learning and OOD detection .

The reviewers all appreciated the novel concept behind the work. I agree with this, I think the principles behind the work are novel and interesting, and I would encourage the authors to improve the validation of this method and publish it in the future.

However, reviewers also raised a number of issues with the current paper: (1) the evaluation appears a bit preliminary, and could be improved significantly with additional datasets and more ablations/comparisons; (2) it's not clear if the improvements from the method are especially significant; (3) the writing could be improved (I do see that the authors made a significant number of changes and improved parts of the paper in response to reviewer concerns to a degree). Probably the writing issues could be fixed, but the skepticism about the experiment results seems harder to address, and while I recognize that the authors made an effort to point some existing ablations in the paper that do address parts of what the reviewers raised, I do think that in the balance the experimental results leave the validation of the work as somewhat borderline.

While less important for the decision, I found that the paper is somewhat overselling the contribution in the opening -- while the particular concept of using gradients as features in this way is interesting, similar ideas have been proposed in the past, and the paper would probably be better if it was more clearly positioned in the context of prior work rather than trying to present a new "framework" like this. It kind of feels like it's biting off too much in the opening, and then delivering a comparatively more modest (but novel and interesting!) technical component.

 Theoretically the paper shows an upper bound for the policy evaluation error, which is a balance of model fitting error and the distance between the stationary distributions under behavior policy and target policy . This serves as a reasonable loss function to train the model . The paper deals with batch RL (aka offline RL) It builds on "Representation Balancing MDP (RepBM)" and tries to improve the procedure by "stationary DIstribution Correction Estimation (DICE) DualDICE"
Gold Metareview 347:
The paper studies offline RL, which is an important topic in high risk domains. Compared with the existing works, this paper gives a tractable method to explicitly learn the model representation w.r.t the stationary distributions of two policies. This method is pretty general and could be paired with other pessimistic model-based RL methods.

The experiments are limited to simpler domains, and could be extended to include harder tasks from other continuous control domains. Some examples could be domains such as in Robosuite (http://robosuite.ai/) or Robogym (https://github.com/openai/robogym). These environments have higher dimensional systems with clearer implications of representation learning. 

There are concerns on writing style and comprehension. 
- The work is on the one hand very specialized, on the other hand just an incremental modification of existing methods. 
- The presentation is very dense and quite hard to grasp, even with the Appendix.
- The formalism, while important, can be very loose in terms of bounds. While that does open questions in RL theory, it would be useful for authors to be more candid about this fact in the paper. 
I would recommend including the response to R1 in the paper.

Other relevant and concurrent papers to potentially take note of:
- Fine-Tuning Offline Reinforcement Learning with Model-Based Policy Optimization (https://openreview.net/forum?id=wiSgdeJ29ee) 
- Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning from Low-Quality Data (https://openreview.net/forum?id=uOjm_xqKEoX)

Given the overall positive reviews, I would recommend acceptance. However, the method would benefit from additional pass on re-writing to make the manuscript more accessible, which in turn to increase impact of this work.

The reverse isn't true: make features more disentangled does not robustly help with multi task learning . The paper has room for improvement, but is already interesting and reasonably well-thought-out of a paper's reviews .

Gold Metareview 348:
This paper aims to look at the relationship between disentanglement
and multi-task learning.  The authors claim to show that disentanglement
emerges naturally from MTL.

The main discussion was whether the claim that disentanglement emerges
naturally from MTL has been adequately demonstrated.  The main  
issue is that MTL results in more extraction of information and that
is hard to disentangle from the disentanglement metrics used.

Reviewers agreed the work was interesting but not as complete as would
be desirable.  I also feel it is not ready for ICLR presentation, but  
with further work could be a nice future contribution.

This paper introduces sparse modeling-inspired regularizations to improve deep neural network-based image generators. Experimental results on both (low-resolution) image synthesis and deep image prior-based inverse problems are used to validate the proposed method.
The majority of the reviewers were against the acceptance of the paper. As summarized by Reviewer tsoA: "There are shortcomings in the overall concept as well as its evaluation. The findings suggest that this might be a promising avenue of research, but it would need to be taken further. At present, the paper boils down too much into simply adding a simple regularizer at the end and observing that it somewhat improves some metrics in a limited number of scenarios. Due to the limitations of the evaluation, it remains unclear whether the proposed improvement carries over to state of the art models and datasets. Similarly, the promised elucidation of the purpose of the feature values never really materializes." The AC agrees with that summarization and recommends rejection.

The main results showed the . cc-universality of G .CNNs in a constructive and unified manner .
Gold Metareview 350:
The paper studies the approximation properties of group convolutional neural networks. It establishes the “cc-universality” of group CNNs, i.e. that such networks can approximate any continuous function over any compact set, using a new constructive approach which is based on a generalization of the ridgelet transform. The proof is constructive, in the sense that approximating networks are given in closed form by discretizing the transform. This approach may have applications beyond the scope of the paper — most immediately, to identifying classes of functions for which neural network approximations are accurate in a quantitative sense; this can be tied to the decay properties of the ridgelet transform. Reviewers found the paper to be clearly written and of high technical quality, albeit somewhat mathematically dense in its presentation. Universal approximation theorems provide an important piece of theoretical background, as well as a “sanity check” for new network architectures; having a unified, constructive approach to derive them could stimulate further work.

This paper presents a new NAS benchmarks for hardware-aware NAS. For each of the architectures in the search space of NAS-Bench-201, it measures hardware performance (energy cost and latency) for six different hardware devices. This is extremely useful for the NAS research community, since it takes very specialized hardware domain knowledge (including machine learning development frameworks, device compilation, embedded systems, and device measurements) as well as the hardware to make these hardware-aware measurements on as many as six (very different) devices. 

The code has been made available to the reviewers during the author response window and has been checked by the reviewers in the meantime. All reviewers appreciated the paper and gave (clear) acceptance scores. 

Before this work, it was very hard for the average NAS researcher to assess their method properly in a hardware-aware setting, and I expect this work to change this, and to open up the very important field of hardware-aware NAS to many more researchers. For this reason I recommend to accept this paper as a spotlight.

This paper gives a way to learn one-hidden-layer neural networks on when the input comes from Gaussian mixture model. The main algorithm uses [Janzamin et al. 2014] as an initialization and then performs gradient descent.

The paper claims certain behavior in the input data would make the problem harder and slow down the convergence, although the claim is based on an upperbound and would be stronger if there is some corresponding lowerbound.

Gold Metareview 357:
The paper presents a new Bayesian optimization method based on the Gaussian process bandits framework for black-box adversarial attacks. The method achieves good performance in the experiments, which was appreciated by all the reviewers.

At the same time, the presentation of the method is quite confusing, which currently precludes acceptance of the paper. In particular, during the discussion phase the reviewers were not able to decipher the algorithm based on the description presented in the paper. It is not clear how the problem is modeled as a bandit problem, what the loss function $\ell$ is minimized and why minimizing it makes sense (assuming, e.g., that $\ell$ it the hinge loss as suggested and the initial prediction is good with a large margin, that is, the loss is zero, equation 6 never changes $x_t$ when the procedure is started from $x$). This connection, since it is the fundamental contribution of the paper, should be much better explained. Once the problem is set up to estimate (maximize?) the reward, it is changed to calculating the difference in the minimization (cf. equation 11), which is again unmotivated. (Other standard aspects of the algorithm should also be explained properly, e.g., the stopping condition of Algorithm 1)

Unfortunately, the paper is written in a mathematically very imprecise manner. As an example, consider equation (6), where $B_p$ and the projection operator are not defined, and while these can be guessed, a projection of the argmin seems to be missing as well in the end (otherwise nothing guarantees that $x_T$, which is the final outcome of the algorithm, remains in the $L_p$ ball). Another example is the $Discrete\ Approximate\ CorrAttack_{Flip}$ paragraph which requires that every coordinate of $x$ should be changed by  $\pm\epsilon$. It is also not clear what "dividing the image into several blocks" means in Section 4.1 (e.g., are these overlapping, do they cover the whole image, etc., not to mention that previously $x$ was a general input, not necessarily an image). It is also unlikely that the stopping condition in Algorithm 1 would use the exact same $\epsilon$ for the acquisition function as the perturbation radius for adversarial examples, etc. While some of these inaccuracies and unclear definitions are also mentioned in the reviews, unfortunately there are more in the paper.

The authors are encouraged to resubmit the paper to the next venue after significantly improving and cleaning up the presentation.

 The authors introduce DiCGAN, an algorithm to learn a generative model that comes up with samples whose likelihood is based on a real dataset but adjusted given user preferences .

The paper presents a method to regularize the discriminator in  GAN training with a ranking loss based on the user preference for a desired set within a larger dataset. The tradeoff between GAN loss and preference loss dependence on the distance of the set to the full dataset and the authors consider two regimes : "small and major correction". A major correction is needed when the targeted set is very different from the whole density, authors propose in this scenario to replace samples from the data by samples from the generator. The setting in the paper is interesting and can be useful in practice. 

There was a lengthy discussions between the authors and the reviewers, the discussion pinpointed issues , some of them were addressed in the rebuttal . Some issues remain unanswered regarding the clarity and some claims in the paper.

This submission describes an approach to compressing the communication in federated learning. The key idea is using a set of random samples from a prior distribution and then performing importance weighed sampling. The work performs an analysis of the privacy guarantees of this process and experimental evaluation.
The main issue with this work is the authors appear to be unaware that the basic problem they pose is solved in a more comprehensive and lossless way in a recent work https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12099 (Feldman and Talwar, ICML 2021). That work shows that any differentially private randomizer can be compressed via a simpler algorithm that performs rejection sampling using a PRG. The algorithm does not loose privacy or utility (under standard cryptographic assumptions) while guaranteeing low communication. In contrast this work loses significantly in utility and provides opaque privacy guarantees.
This submission analyzes  a randomized that adds Gaussian distribution and, in particular, the compression technique in (Feldman and Talwar) applies to it. The technique proposed in this work is very similar in spirit (with prior distribution corresponding to reference distribution in the earlier work.
In light of the earlier work I do not think the contributions in this submission are sufficient for publication.

Gold Metareview 365:
This paper focuses on the problem of performing imitation learning from trajectory-level data that includes optimal as well as suboptimal demonstrations.  The authors wish to avoid the requirement of a separate filtering process that would throw away the bad trajectories.  The authors propose a clever innovation that allows for leveraging the policy that is itself being learned to reweight the samples for a next round of weighted behavioral cloning.  The paper is also somewhat theoretically rigorous and provides insight into the problem. 

The reviewers pointed out some initial issues related to clarity and the authors did a good job of addressing reviewer concerns.  Ultimately all reviewers agreed that the core innovation of the paper was interesting and empirically worked reasonably well.  

One older line of work that I think is quite relevant, but which is not discussed, is the empirically observed "clean-up effect", described by Michie and colleagues in the 90s (e.g. "Learning to fly" Sammut et al 1992).  This clean-up effect is intuitive and reportedly achieved for free in settings where the learning objective is mode-seeking and the dataset is large, insofar as the mean value of the resulting policy *should* produce actions that corresponds to the average action produced by demonstrators in the same situation.  I think it would be worth discussing how the analysis of this paper relates to this empirical phenomenon. In particular, it would be worth clarifying in what regimes the suboptimality of training from a dataset with noisy examples arises and how likely this is to effect the mean value of the learned policy (for context, it is fairly common in practice to evaluate the student policy in BC settings by only using the mean action value; perhaps this point was present in the paper, and I missed it). From a certain perspective, the innovation of this paper is to accentuate the clean-up effect.

As noted by a reviewer, and subsequently incorporated into the paper, the actual algorithm has some similarities to versions of recent "offline RL" algorithms (though of course it does not leverage rewards).  In particular, the motif of performing a weighted regression could perhaps be a bit more thoroughly contextualized by connecting it to other weighting factors (e.g. see Critic Regularized Regression).  That said, I leave this entirely to the discretion of the authors.

The final scores were 8, 7, & 6.  I see this as a strong paper and will endorse it for a spotlight.

This paper proposes an extra loss to add on top of the contrastive learning. The contrastive learning seek representations invariant to transformation, while the extra loss the authors proposed encourage representations to be equivariant to the transformation (i.e. retain information about transformation in later representations). While reviewers and I agree this is a sensible motivation, and acknowledge good results that authors have obtained, the fact that most, if not all, improvement is combing from the 4-way rotation transformation is a bit unsatisfactory. Furthermore, this additional loss was proposed before and is actually quite well known, so the actual novelty in the proposed technique is somewhat limited. Nevertheless, this paper provides a comprehensive evaluation, obtaining a reasonable improvement, and makes a good case for using an equivariant seeking loss. The authors are strongly encouraged to release their code (including training details for reproducing ImageNet results) as the improvements they present are central to the acceptance.

Gold Metareview 367:
This paper presents a closed loop planning system that leverages LLMs for providing candidate plans given the success of action execution and the world state. Central to the approach is querying the LLM given the instruction and text prompts capturing success of skill execution and a description of the scene. 

This is a systems oriented paper demonstrating and evaluating the utility of a LLM for interleaved planning and execution. The paper is well organised and clearly written. The results highlight the utility of LLMs to enable task execution before an explicit learning of a task model (given primitive robot skills amenable to composition). Further, experiments demonstrate contextual plan adaptation and success goal reaching for simulated and real data sets. 

The main limitation of the work was observed to be the specialised nature of feedback prompts necessary for successful task execution. A clarification was sought if the proposed system has a principled way to determining the necessary feedback and to what extent the feedback is to be adjusted for long-running plans. In response, the authors clarified that the feedback is not hand crafted. Further,  the authors articulated their contribution towards demonstrating  the ability of LLM-based planners to integrated multi-modal feedback without focusing on the specific problem of determine how much or how best such a feedback may be generated. In response to a reviewer’s suggestion, the authors provided a comparison of models with and without feedback with an increase in the task horizon. 

Additionally, the reviewers inquired the degree to which plan recovery is possible in the proposed framework. In response, the authors drew attention to results where plan adaptation occurs when an object falls is no longer in the reachable workspace. The reviewers further requested for a comparison with a baseline that searches over a set of high-candidate plans. As suggested, the authors provided a comparison with a Next Best Decoding that uses the next most likely skill. 

Overall, the inclusion of new experimental insights strengthens the paper. A clear articulation of the technical advance in relation to Zang et al. 2022 is also recommended in the main manuscript.

 SignCorpus is the largest ever collected sign language pretraining dataset . This is very useful for finetuning neural network models for multilingual sign identification and finger spelling . The data gathering procedure is well described and justified, using techniques inspired of other tasks, datasets and models that have similar obstacles, such as low resource . Overall the paper is very well structured, easy to follow and critical for sign language ML research in my opinion .

This paper presents a significant collection of unlabelled signing data (4.6K hours) across 10 sign languages, which have been pre-processed and converted to pose-keypoints to remove identifiable information. The paper also presents Multi-ISLR a multilingual dataset with label-alignment extracted from 11 other labelled datasets for 7 sign languages. Furthermore, the paper also provides a multilingual model, Sign2Vec, pre-trained on the unlabelled data, and fine-tuned on the labelled data, which shows the SOTA results for known tasks. Lastly, the paper also introduces a dataset for fingerspelling across 7 languages. It's likely that this work will pave the way for new research on multilingual signed language tasks.

**pros:**
* The paper provides a significant expansion for unlabelled and labelled signed data (previous work focused only on Indian Signed Languages)
* The data gathering procedure is well documented and justified
* The experimental results provide evidence of the value of the data.


**cons**
* For the SignCorpus there is a lack of a human verification process, that assesses the quality of the pose keypoints; i.e. whether they can be used by native signers to extract the target gloss.

Meta Review: This paper studies the problem of top-K recovery from a fixed set of queries. In each query, the user is presented m items and they select the item with the highest noisy utility. The authors propose a simple solution to this problem, take top-K most frequently chosen items, and prove that it is near optimal. The proposed solution is simple and valid only under strong assumptions, the utility of the query is additive in its items and the item utility noise is independent.

This paper proposes a unified model-based framework for high-level skill learning and composition through hierarchical RL. The proposed approach combines high-level planning in a low dimensional space with low-level skill learning, where each low-level skill is a policy conditioned on the high-level task.

The proposed approach is evaluated on locomotion tasks, and is shown to be overall more data efficient than alternative baselines.

This work presents a method for training neural nets on synthetic data. This data is collected from a collection of thousands of OpenGL programs that rendered images, which are then used for representation learning. The big advantage of this approach is that it avoids of a lot of the biases that are present in natural image datasets. The proposed method is competitive for supervised and unsupervised scenarios.

During training, control-flow paths with low ELBOs are periodically pruned, so that computation is focused on paths that appear to have relatively high posterior probability . Finally, the learned . variational . families are combined into a mixture, with mixture weights based on estimated ELBO weights for each path .

The authors design an algorithm for composite stochastic optimization that leverages both smoothness and strong convexity with respect to the same (general) norm, using a stochastic counterpart to recent work by Diakonikolas and Guzman.

Compared to Frank-Wolfe, the algorithm requires strictly less gradient evaluations and parallelizes the same amount of linear optimization computations.

The paper received generally favorable reviews, with the exception of reviewer 3QVT who did not engage in discussion and whose critique I found unclear. I agree with reviewer rQnJ’s assessment that even though “all the building block are quite known in optimization community (accelerated methods, duality, Bregman distances, smoothing, etc.), the whole approach fits perfectly together and provides the reader with a number of nice and useful observations.” Consequently, I recommend acceptance.

 This paper studies the problem of identifying (discovering) synonymous entities . The paper proposes using the "contexts" of the entities as they occur in associated text corpora (e.g. Wiki) The key novelties of the approach lie in the "matching" system used, where contexts of one entity are matched with that for the other entity .

This paper presents a model to identify entity mentions that are synonymous.  This could have utility in practical scenarios that handle entities.

The main criticism of the paper is regarding the baselines used.  Most of the baselines that are compared against are extremely simple.  There is a significant body of literature that models paraphrase and entailment and many of those baselines are missing (decomposable attention, DIIN, other cross-attention mechanisms).  Adding those experiments would make the experimental setup stronger.

Gold Metareview 394:
This paper develops a smoothing procedure to avoid the problem of posterior collapse in VAEs. The method is interesting and novel, the experiments are well executed, and the authors answered satisfactorily to most of the reviewers' concerns. However, there is one remaining issue that would require additional discussion. As identified by Reviewer 1, the analysis in Section 3 is only valid when the number of layers is 2. Above that value, "it is possible to construct models where the ELBO has a reasonable value, but the smoothed objective behaves catastrophically". Thus, the scope of the analysis in Section 3 deserves further discussion. Given the large number of ICLR submissions, this paper unfortunately does not meet the acceptance bar. That said, I encourage the authors to address this point and resubmit the paper to another (or the same) venue.

The paper is concerned with learning transformation equivariant node representation of graph data in an unsupervised setting.

Reviewers highlighted the promising ideas of the approach, its relevance for the ICLR community, and the promising experimental results (although improvements over prior work are not necessarily significant on all benchmarks).

However, reviewers raised concerns regarding the novelty of the method and the clarity of presentation with respect to key parts of the method. These aspects connect also to further concerns raised, e.g., related to mathematical correctness as well as the significance of the proposed loss function, the benefits of motivating it from MI, and the improvements over GraphTER. The rebuttal didn't fully clarify these points. While the paper is mostly solid, I agree with the reviewers' concerns and -- currently -- the paper doesn't clear the bar for acceptance; it would require another revision to improve upon these points. However, I'd encourage the authors to revise and resubmit their work with considering this feedback.

 In this paper, their goal is to improve calibration and accuracy by augmenting a classification model with a GP . They base their model off RIO (ICLR 2020) which targets regression problems and tries to predict the residual between predicted value and true value . My main concern is that some additional methods need to be compared with. For example, using a bayesian last layer or using MC-dropout at test time . The method is straightforward to implement and performs well against the baselines considered on classification tasks for 125 UCI datasets .
Gold Metareview 396:
In this paper, the authors use a GP classifier to detect if the output of a NN classifier has been decided correctly. The GP takes as input the original input vector x and the output of the NN, i.e. the calibrated posterior probabilities given by the NN. It uses that as an input vector for the GP classifier to decide if the sample was correctly decided. The output of the GP will serve as confidence in the output of the NN. The results are comparable/superior with the state-of-the-art and the authors have repeated the experiments with over 125 different datasets. The reviewers of this paper were all cautiously positive about the paper, but all of them pointed towards the reduced novelty of the paper. Also, none of the reviewers were willing to champion this paper as a must-have at ICLR 2021.
 
For my reading of the paper, I would tend to agree with the reviewers’ comments. Also, I find that using the same NN, rather shallow, with the same configuration for all the datasets seems rather limited. Given that this method is independent of the underlying classifier and that the databases used are low dimensions and a low number of training examples, I would have liked to see what a random forest or a GP can accomplish. Also, I would have used bigger NNs that can be trained to overfit the sigmoid outputs for classification of higher accuracy. I believe that having a diversity of underlying classifiers is more relevant than having 125 datasets. We need to find the best classifier or ensemble and then apply the different mechanisms for estimating if the output is the correct one. Otherwise, the proposed method might only be workable for this specific NN configuration. In the tables, it can be hinted that this might be happening, as about 80% of the cases MCP and RED are indistinguishable in the AUROC values.
 
Also, for all of these datasets a GP could be used as an underlying classifier, and given the premises of this paper, the authors could check how well calibrate a GP classifier is. Also, there has been considerable work on calibrating NNs when they are trained to overfit. Comparing with those methods should be straightforward, as they provide more information than just a confidence score. This is probably the most influential paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04599 (1000+ references), but there are some recent papers too.  
 
Finally, if the goal is to use a GP to detect if the classification done by the NNs is accurate, using a GP might be an overkill, as the complexity of the GP, especially for large datasets might end up being larger than the underlying classifier.

 The bootstrap framework suggests that understanding generalization reduces to understanding optimization in the online setting . Empirically, it demonstrates that such gap (soft-error) is small in supervised image classification for typical deep learning model architectures . The authors present empirical evidence that the bootstrap error (in terms of soft error) is consistently low in image classification settings across a number of architectures . However, I have respect for this paper trying to define some statistical terms in the deep learning society . I have a very strong concern about the novelty, as it appears to be trivial or hard to understand .
Gold Metareview 397:
The paper is proposing a new framework for understanding generalization in the deep learning. The main idea is considering the difference of stochastic optimization on a population risk and optimization on an empirical risk. The classical theory considers the difference of empirical risk and population risk. This basically translates the practical motivation from finding good function classes to finding good optimizers which can re-use the data effectively. Although the paper provides no theoretical result, it provides an interesting empirical study. The paper somewhat demonstrates that SGD on deep networks is somehow good at re-using the same data. I believe this angle is very novel and might hope to future theoretical discoveries. The paper is reviewed by four reviewers and two of them argue its acceptance and two of them argue rejection. After discussion, this status remained and I carefully read and reviewed the paper. Here are the major issues raised by the reviewers:

- R#1: The paper is missing a theoretical study. The implications on the practical deep learning is not clear.
- R#2: Choice of the soft-error is particular to the task and how to go beyond soft-max is not clear.
- R#3: Finds the paper not novel as well as trivial or hard to understand.
- R#4: The choice of soft error is ad-hoc.

I believe the issues raised by R#3 are not justified. First of all, novelty is very clear and. appreciated by other reviewers. Moreover, the paper is rather easy to understand and the results are very farm from trivial. However, the other issues raised by other reviewers are valid. Specifically, soft-error seems to be a limitation of the study. However, the authors respond to this concern and reviewer increases their score. I believe the theory is lacking but the paper is simply showing this novel approach and its empirical validity. A theory to explain this phenomenon would be amazing but not necessary for publication. Similarly, without a theory it is hard to expect any practical implication. Overall, I believe the paper is an interesting and novel one which will likely to lead additional work in the area. Considering we are still far from a satisfying theory of generalization for deep learning and the role of the optimization is clear, this angle worth sharing with the community. Hence, I decide to accept. However, I have some concerns which should be addressed by the camera-ready. 

- Claims should be revised and authors should make sure they have enough evidence for them. For example, authors provide no satisfying evidence for random labels or very limited evidence for pre-training. I strongly recommend authors to either remove some of these discussions or present in a fashion which is not a result but part of the discussion for future research.
- A section about limitations should be added. Specifically, the soft-error choice should be discussed in this limitation section.
- Discussion section should be extended with the pointers to the relevant work on bootstrap literature as well as suggestions to the theoreticians. Not providing any theoretical result is always fine but authors should understanding why is it hard to make theoretical statements and where to search them.

The topic is maximally timely and important: Understanding human
decision-making behaviour based on observational data. Any tangible
steps towards this challenging goal are bound to be significant, and
those this paper makes.

A Bayesian policy-learning method is introduced for this task, and
validated on both simulated data and user exeperiments in a real
decision-making task. The novel contribution is on learning
interpretable decision dynamics

The paper is written clearly enough..

The updated paper clarified most major concerns the reviewers had. In
particular, they added a user study.

The biggest remaining weaknesses are that

- relationship to the AMM model did not become completely clear yet

- the real user study has been carried out with only a small set of
users. But a large-cohort study would be too much work to ask for a
paper which has also a strong methodological contribution.


Generated Summary 401:
 The paper presents a novel solution to an interesting problem - when KBs are automatically expanded user feedback is crucial to identify incorrect and missing entity attributes and relations . The human computation aspects of the paper are lacking sufficient explanation in terms of implementation in real settings . The proposed method represents user feedback as feedback mentions and uses an online algorithm for integrating these mentions into the KB . It is unclear about the algorithm implementation, such as what is the implementation of feedback mention .

The paper presents an interesting methodology. The results are interesting, however the paper really misses out on an in-depth discussion and reflection of the pros and cons of this approach as well as on a proper related work comparison to similar approaches.

 The authors analyze a self-supervised learning framework for downstream (supervised) few-shot classification . The authors show that the method minimizes an upper bound on an oracle supervised distance-based classification loss . Decreasing SSL loss does not necessarily mean that supervised learning loss is also decreased . The main concern is that Theorem 1 and 2 are quite loose . Is it work for any fk and fq? Can you provide more strict error bound to quantify the difference?
Gold Metareview 402:
This paper proposed to theoretically explain why a pre-trained embedding network with self-supervised training (SSL) can provide representation for downstream few-shot learning (FSL) tasks. The review process finds that the paper may over-claim the results and that the results seem unsatisfactory. Both Reviewer 4 and Reviewer 5 expressed concerns regarding the writing, organizing, and grammar errors of this paper. The paper needs a substantial revision to improve clarity and accessibility. As pointed out by Nikunj Saunshi’s public comment, this paper may benefit from discussing the differences from the previous works, including [1].

Generated Summary 403:
 The proposed approach of requesting expert feedback for the top ranked anomalies is straightforward and unsurprising given past work on active learning . The experiments on synthetic data are also unsurprising . The paper's organization is, at times quite confusing . The introduction is unusually short, with a 1st paragraph virtually unreadable due to the abuse of citations . Most claims of novelty can be clearly refuted such as the first sentence of the abstract "...This work presents a new approach to active anomaly detection..." and the paper does not give due credit to existing work .
Gold Metareview 403:
Following the unanimous vote of the reviewers, this paper is not ready for publication at ICLR. The most significant concern raised is that there does not seem to be an adequate research contribution. Moreover, unsubstantiated claims of novelty do not adequately discuss or compare to past work.

 Attention-based clustering (ABC) incorporates context to learn a metric in the form of an embedding and kernel similarity layer (predefined) An off-the-shelf clustering algorithm (e.g. spectral clustering) is used to cluster the similarity matrix (number of clusters pre-specified or inferred) The experiments show favorable results on the toy dataset and are competitive with methods that use a prespecified clustering .
Gold Metareview 404:
This paper proposes to use context-based metric learning, where an attention/Transformer-based mechanism is used to incorporate neighborhood information for deep learning-based metric learning. This was initially demonstrated on two simpler datasets, although larger ones were added during the rebuttal. On the whole, reviewers appreciated the simplicity and intuition behind the idea, but the consensus among all of the reviewers found several aspects lacking, including: 1) clarity of the descriptions in the paper, 2) novelty compared to existing work, especially that of Set Transformer for clustering, 3) lack of convincing results compared to baselines, or at least analysis/justification for negative results. While the reviewers appreciated the authors' rebuttal and experiments, it did not address many of these concerns. The idea is interesting and seems to hold some promise, so the authors are encouraged to refine these aspects in order to fully explore this idea and submit to a future venue.

 Confident Adaptive Language Modeling (CALM) is practically useful to speed up the inference where autoregressive decoding with large language models is quite expensive . The paper wasn't very clear in comparing the final performance to the many prior works such as Elbayad et al or Schwartz et al . The authors adequately addressed the limitations and potential negative societal impact of their work . The proposed method is shown to result in potential speedup of up to 3x .
Gold Metareview 405:
This paper studies the error of early exit in decoding Transformer Language models, and proposes a method CALM to calibrate and accelerate model inference. Experiments on a variety of tasks (summarization, MT, QA) show effectiveness of the proposed method. 
All reviewers find the paper solid and the author feedback convincing.

 Paper proposes novel architecture and regularization technique for RNN . Hidden state of an RNN is one of (or weighted average of) a finite number of learnable clusters . This has two claimed benefits: extracting finite state automata from RNNs is much simpler, and (2) forces RNN to operate like an automata and less like finite state machines . The main claim of the paper is that SR-LSTM can extrapolate to longer sequences, unlike LSTM . However, the sequence lengths considered are too small .
Gold Metareview 406:
the authors propose to incorporate an additional layer between the consecutive steps in LSTM by introducing a radial basis function layer (with dot product kernel and softmax) followed by a linear layer to make LSTM similar to or better at (by being more explicit) capturing DFA-like transition. the motivation is relatively straightforward, but it does not really resolve the issue of whether existing formulations of RNN's cannot capture such transition. since this was not shown theoretically nor intuitively, it is important for empirical evaluations to be thorough and clearly show that the proposed approach does indeed outperform the vanilla LSTM (with peepholes) when the capacity (e.g., the number of parameters) matches. unfortunately it has been the consensus among the reviewers that more thorough comparison on more conventional benchmarks are needed to convince them of the merit of the proposed approach.

 Domain decomposition solvers are effective for large-scale PDE problems . Schwarz domain decomposition methods are commonly used for structured-grid problems . In this work, the authors proposed to learn the parameters in Schwarz preconditioner that generalize it to unstructured grid and enable faster convergence .

 This work provides an empirical evaluation of similarity metrics used in example-based explanations methods . The goal is to provide decision support examples in the training set for a black-box model's prediction . Authors investigate which relevance metrics are desirable for explanations that are based on extracting similar instances as evidence to support a model prediction . They establish three minimal requirements for those metrics:  model randomization to ensure the measure is model-specific . The cosine similarity of the gradients of the loss performed the best .
Gold Metareview 408:
This paper performs an empirical comparison of similarity-based attribution methods, which aim to "explain" model predictions via training samples. To this end, the authors propose a handful of metrics intended to measure the acceptability of such methods. While one reviewer took issue with the proposed criteria, the general consensus amongst reviewers is that this provides at least a start for measuring and comparing instance-attribution methods. 

In sum, this is a worthwhile contribution to the interpretability literature that provides measures for comparing and contrasting explanation-by-training-example methods.

 This paper targets at stylizing a mesh with a text prompt . It represents appearance of a mesh as spatially varying BRDF, normal and lighting . It matches the CLIP feature of rendered image and given text prompt by learning parameters of these components . The impact of the work is incremental, but the general direction of text-guided geometry/ texture generation is a significant one . It describes a method for generating a reflectance map (and lighting environment) for a given 3D shape, using a CLIP-guided loss .
Gold Metareview 409:

This paper presents a new CLIP-driven stylization method given an input mesh and text description. Compared to previous works Text2Mesh, the paper introduces a more expressive rendering model based on learnable SVBRDF and normal maps. Many reviewers found the paper easy to follow, the idea promising, and the results visually appealing. They also expressed their concerns regarding the similarity to Text2Mesh, the limitations of the normal maps approach (compared to changing geometry explicitly), and the relighting and material editing of the stylized object. The rebuttal has addressed most of the concerns. The AC agreed with most of the reviewers and recommended accepting the paper. 

Please revise the papers according to the reviewer’s comments: (1) change the title according to Reviewer kpuS, (2) add relighting/material editing/view synthesis results, and (3) highlight the pros and cons of the proposed method w.r.t. Text2Mesh.

This paper proposes a new gradient-based attribution method Distilled Gradient Aggregation (DGA), which combines the strengths of both local and global attribution methods. The reviewers and meta-reviewer found the method novel, and supported by promising results both qualitatively and quantitatively. 

During the rebuttal phase, the authors made a _thorough_ effort in response to each reviewer's comments. As recognized by two reviewers (hnze, cvDy), the newly added results and discussions have significantly strengthened the contribution. 

The AC recommends acceptance given the paper tackles a critical problem, and presented an effective and convincing method that advances the field of explainable AI. 

Authors are strongly recommended to include these new results and writing changes suggested by the reviewers for the final version of the manuscript.

 This paper tries to understand the over-smoothing phenomenon of Transformer-based models such as BERT . The analysis is from the perspective of viewing BERT and Transformer as graph neural networks . Layer normalization plays a key role in the issue . If the standard deviation of layer normalization is sufficiently large, the output of the Transformer stacks will converge to a specific low-rank subspace . My major concern is about the clarity of some parts of the paper and some improvement .
Gold Metareview 411:
This paper has a deep analysis of the over-smoothing phenomenon in BERT from the perspective of graph. Over-smoothing refers to token uniformity problem in BERT, different input patches mapping to similar latent representation in ViT and the problem of shallower representation better than deeper (overthinking). The authors build a relationship between Transformer blocks and graphs. Namely, self-attention matrix can be regarded as a normalized adjacency matrix of a weighted graph. They prove that if the standard deviation in layer normalization is sufficiently large, the outputs of the transformer stack will converge to a low-rank subspace, resulting in over-smoothing.

In this paper, they also provide theoretical proof why higher layers can lead to over-smoothing. Empirically , they investigate the effects of the magnitude of the two standard deviations between two consecutive layers on possible over-smoothing in diverse tasks.

In order to overcome over-smoothing, they propose a series of hierarchical fusion strategy that adaptively fuses presentation from different layers, including concatenation fusion, max fusion and self-gate fusion into post-normalization. These strategies reduce similarities between tokens and outperforms BERT baseline on a few datasets (GLUE, SWAG and SQuAD).

Overall I agree with reviewers that this is a good contribution.

Gold Metareview 412:
This paper presents U-WILDS, an extension of the multi-task, large-scale domain-shift dataset WILDS. The authors propose an extensive array of experiments evaluating the ability of a wide variety of algorithms to leverage the unlabelled data to address domain-shift problems. The vision behind sounds quite ambitious and convincing to me, namely, the proposed U-WILDS benchmark would be a useful and well-motivated resource for the ML community, and their experiments were very comprehensive. Although they did not introduce any new methods in this paper, U-WILDS significantly expands the range of modalities, applications, and shifts available for studying and benchmarking real-world unsupervised adaptation.

The clarity, vision and significance are clearly above the bar of ICLR. While the reviewers had some concerns on the novelty, the authors did a particularly good job in their rebuttal. Thus, all of us have agreed to strongly accept this paper for publication! Please include the additional rebuttal discussion in the next version.

 This paper proposes a second-order algorithm for training neural networks in the L2 regression setting . It provides a theoretical analysis of its complexity in the over-parametrized regime . The main claim is that the computation cost of each iteration of the proposed methods is sub-quadratic in terms of the network width . Several claims about the literature are not accurate . The ideas in this paper can inspire new algorithms that enjoy lower per-iteration costs .
Gold Metareview 413:
This paper studies the performance of second-order algorithms on training multi-layers over-parameterized neural networks. The authors propose an algorithm based on the Gram-Gauss-Newton method, tensor-based sketching techniques, and preconditioning to train such a network, whose runtime is subquadratic in the width of the neural network. While some reviewers provide some weak support, none of them are in strong support, even after the author's response. I think one of the reasons is the lack of empirical experiments. Since the main claim of this paper is an efficient second-order algorithm, some experiments are necessary to back up this claim. Unfortunately, the authors did not try to add such an experiment during the rebuttal. I would suggest the authors add such experiments in the revision.

This paper introduces an interesting cooperative-competitive MARL environment involving groups of camera and targets with the objective of transportation. The benchmark environment appears to be scalable with novel components including partial observability and general-sum rewards in an interesting environment.

The majority of reviewers appraised the work positively, and the authors adequately addressed the concerns brought up in the review along with a revision incorporating some components of feedback. I think this is a good addition to the MARL literature, and the authors should be sure to incorporate all the remaining feedback in the final version of the paper.

 This paper studies why optimization-based adversarial attacks have close to zero target transferability in attack real-world ASR pipelines . The definition of a “factor” is not clear in this paper . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . It still lacks root cause analysis on the findings to indeed “demystify” the low attack transferability . The authors provide a useful beginning of understanding why ASR systems may be not susceptible to targeted transferable attacks .
Gold Metareview 417:
This paper explores why adversarial examples do not transfer well in
adversarial examples on automatic speech recognition systems. The authors
propose a number of potential causes that are then quickly evaluated in
turn.

This could be an excellent paper, but in its current form, it is borderline.
The main problem with the paper is that it proposes a number of causes for the
limited transferability, and then evaluates each of them with one quick
experiment and just a paragraph of text. In particular, none of the results
actually convince me that the claim is definitely correct, and many of the
experimental setups are confusing or would have other explanations other than
the one variable that is aiming to be controlled for.

That said, even with these weaknesses, this paper raises interesting and new
questions with an approach I have not seen previosuly. So while I don't believe
the paper has done much to actually demystify transferability, it does take
steps towards performing scientific experiments to understand why it is so
hard. And these experiments, while not perfect, can serve as the basis for
future work to extend and understand which factors are most important.

 The paper tackles the problem of neural networks learning ‘simple’ features which cannot generalize well . It proposes to alleviate this problem of shortcut learning by generating synthetic data (“roadblocks”) in a manner which confuses the network while being close (in $l_2$ norm) to the original training data . The proposed approach shows promising results on CelebA and BAR, however, the clarity and presentation can be significantly improved .
Gold Metareview 418:
The submission describes a new method to avoid the shortcut learning behaviour in DNNs. After the rebuttal and discussion, most of the reviewers are positive about this submission since the proposed method does not require prior knowledge about the dataset and the strong empirical results for the debasing task. On the negative results, the reviewers argue that the experimental evaluation is not thorough enough. Overall, AC recommends acceptance but asks the authors to perform more rigorous evaluation for the camera-ready version including the fair tuning of the hyperparameters.

 The authors propose a new penalization framework for the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with fairness constraints . They formalize the penalized regret to evaluate the performance of bandit algorithms under this setting . Experiments on synthetic data show its superiority over other existing methods .

Gold Metareview 419:
The paper provides an algorithm for the stochastic multi armed bandit (MAB) problem in the regime with fairness constraints. It continues a line of work that in high level define fairness as a requirement to ensure a minimum amount of exploration for every arm.
The main concern I found in the reviews regards the definition of fairness in this paper. Although it follows the same high level narrative of previous works its exact definition and difference from previous papers is not convincingly motivated, and seems to be tailored to the proposed algorithm rather to a real world fairness constraint. This issue could have been mitigated by a novel or generalizable technique, or insightful experiments, but this does not seem to be the case given the reviewers comment about the limited novelty and basic experiments.

 A paper proposes a method of compressing neural radience fields (NeRF's) by learning mappings from latent codes to model parameters . While maintaining the same level of quality, this method is able to compress NeRF models for more efficient sender-to-receiver transmission . The paper proposes to add entropy penalized reparametrization technique into Nerf (Mildenhall et al. (2020) and compress the neural network in Nerf . However, the multiple scenes experiments are not performed well to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method .
Gold Metareview 421:
Description:
The paper presents a method for encoding a compressed version of an implicit 3D scene, from given images from arbitrary view points. This is achieved via a function, learning with a NeRF model, that maps spatial coordinates to a radiance vector field and is optimized for high compressibility and low reconstruction error. Results shows better compression, higher reconstruction quality and lower bitrates compared to other STOA.

Strengths:
- Method for significantly compressing NerF models, which is very useful since such models are often trained for every new scene
- Retain reconstruction quality after compression by an order of magnitude
 
Weaknesses:
- The need for decompressing the model before rendering can be done means reduced rendering speed. This also requires longer training times.
- Experiments against other scene compression + neural rendering technique will have further strengthened the papers’s claims 
- The techniques used are well established, and thus there is not as much technical novelty.


Generated Summary 422:
 The reviewer would like to see the paper published on important venue like ICLR . This paper demonstrates on several fairly simple (e.g. 1-dimensional quadratic) objectives that stochastic descent may easily have very poor behavior: it could diverge to a maximum, or diverge even in convex settings if the learning rate is too high . Many theoretical works have studied SGD, but they commonly rely on strict and unrealistic assumptions about the noise . This raises many interesting questions regarding the effect of noise in optimization .
Gold Metareview 422:
Overall, the paper provides interesting counter examples for the SGD with constant step-size (that relies on a relative noise model that diminishes at the critical points), which provide critical (counter) insights into what we consider as good convergence metrics, such as expected norm of the gradient. 

The initial submission took a controversial position between the mathematical statements and the presentation of the statements on the behavior of the SGD method in non-convex optimization problems. While the mathematical is sufficient for acceptance at ICLR, the presentation was inferring conclusions that could have been misread by the community.

I am really happy to state that the review as well as the rebuttal processes helped improved the presentation of the results that I am excited to recommend acceptance.

Gold Metareview 426:
This work is well written and accurately covers the context and recent related work. It's a good example of how to apply self-supervised training to the event sequence domain. However, the combination of a lack of technical originality (composing a set of previously explored ideas) and significant improvements in results (results with CoLES overlap in error bars with RTD results) limits the impact of this paper.

Pros:
- Well written.
- Extensive evaluation.
- Well formulated problem.

Cons:
- Lack of technical novelty. The method appears to be general to all sequences rather than specialized for event sequences so the motivation for this design is not crystal clear.
- Minor improvement in results from using the method despite written claims that the method 'significantly outperforms'.
- Limited analysis that shows the periodicity and repeatability in the data.

The reviewers agreed that there are some promising ideas in this work, and useful empirical analysis to motivate the approach. The main concern is in the soundness of the approach (for example, comments about cumulative learning and negative samples). The authors provided some justification about using previous networks as initialization, but this is an insufficient discussion to understand the soundness of the strategy. The paper should better discuss this more, even if it is not possible to provide theory. The paper could also be improved with the addition of a baseline (though not necessarily something like DeepStack, which is not publicly available and potentially onerous to reimplement).

The paper is about adapting a voice generation model to new speakers with minimal amount of training data. The key insight in this paper is that the voice can be adapted using a small set of variables -- the bias and the variance associated with the layer that normalizes the mel-spectrogram associated with the decoder. Additionally, they characterize voice at the utterance level to capture stationary factors like background acoustic conditions and at the phoneme level to capture factors such as prosody, though there are no explicit constraints to force such representation.

The strength of the paper are:
+ Simplicity of the approach
+ Empirical evaluation that demonstrates its effectiveness

The weakness of the paper are:
- analysis of what the crucial parameters of the model represent
- lack of clarity that is obvious from several back-and-forths between the reviewers and the author.

A few examples include:
- “There is also a phoneme-level acoustic embedding which is used in the same way, which at inference is taken from random sentences (why not in training?), and, I guess, is supposed to cover phoneme-level idiosyncrasies of the speaker, although this isn't clear to me.”
- “ it is only the speaker embedding that is the input to fine-tuning, and this only via the normalization parameters. (Both the normalization parameters and the speaker embedding itself are fine-tuned.) I am not sure what the speaker-embedding is left to do with all this acoustic-level input, but OK.”

This paper looks at problems that have sparse rewards, are partially observable, and have variable initial conditions .

There was quite a bit of internal discussion on this paper. To summarize:
- The idea is very neat and interesting and likely to work
- The paper is likely to inspire future work
- There are still serious doubts  about the experimental evaluation that is not entirely up to par with current standards
  - The reviewers were not convinced 100% by the arguments about the 'custom' environments
  - The reviewers were not convinced 100% that the baselines were given their best shot

While the paper has potential to provide valuable input for the community, it needs a bit more work before being presentable at a highly competitive venue like ICLR.

 Theorem 1 is quite straightforward from results in Osband & Van Roy 2014 . For general cases, posterior sampling could also be expensive as there are no closed-form solutions, one may need to use MCMC method . The paper proposes a model-based posterior sampling algorithms with regret guarantees when the model is assumed to be drawn from a distribution randomly . The definition of $BayesRegret$ seems incorrect as it takes $M^*$ as argument .

This paper presents a model-based posterior sampling algorithm in continuous state-action spaces theoretically and empirically. The work is interesting and the authors provide numerical evaluations of the proposed method. But the reviewers find the contribution of the work limited.

 This work proposed an approach that generates radiology reports from chest x-ray images by splitting pathology-related sentences and the others . The experimental setup should be more rigorous . The proposed method uses CNN for image classification on Chest X-rays and CNN-RNN structure is then applied to generate reports . Different strategy is applied for normal/abnormal cases . The results seem promising . The paper reads well and the methodology is relatively clear . The method is also shown to perform well compared with Li et al. (2018) and Xue .

This paper presents a pipeline for automatic interpretation of  medical imaging and learning-based diagnosis. On the one hand, the paper tackles an important and challenging problem, but on the other hand, the validation is very limited and novelty over previous work is unclear.

 This submission derives new generalization bounds for tuning the regularization parameters for ridge-regression, LASSO, and the elastic net methods . In particular, the authors study two settings: (i) tuning based on multiple draws of train/test splits from a fixed (but arbitrary) problem distribution and (ii) online learning . The authors go on to show that validation losses can be minimized in an online setting, where we view each validation loss one-by-one . The paper seems to be theoretically sound and follows a logical progression .
Gold Metareview 434:
The reviewers agreed that this paper should be accepted -- it studies an interesting and in someways "overlooked" problem and seems like it could be a starting point for others to build on. The paper did have some weaknesses. For example, we feel that the lack of experimental results is a missed opportunity -- the reviewers feel the paper would be made stronger by including at least a simple example where the standard approach of grid search + CV fails. Without such an example, it is a bit hard to be convinced of the importance of the problem being studied.

 This work introduces a new family of Bregman divergences for density ratio estimation with flexible models that aims at solving the train-loss hacking problem . The paper is well written, although difficult to follow without some theoretical background . The experiments do not include BR_BKL nor nnBR_BkL, which I would have found quite interesting . The main drawback of the paper is that it is very hard to read, overloaded with cumbersome notation .
Gold Metareview 435:
This paper discusses the likelihood ratio estimation using the Bregman divergence.  The authors consider the 'train-loss hacking', which is an overfitting issue causing minus infinity for the divergence.   They introduce non-negative correction for the divergence under the assumption that we have knowledge on the upper bound of the density ratio.  Some theoretical results on the convergence rate are given.  The proposed method shows favorable performance on outlier detection and covariate shift adaptation.

The proposed non-negative modification of Bregman divergence is a reasonalbe solution to the important problem of density ratio estimation.  The experimental results as well as theoretical justfication make this work solid.  However, there are some concerns also.  The paper assumes knowledge on the upper bound of density ratio and uses a related parameter essentially in the method.  Assuming the upper bound  is a long standing problem in estimating density ratio, and it is in practice not necesssarily easy to obtain.  Also, there is a room on improvements on readability. 

Although this paper has some signicance on the topic, it does not reach the acceptance threshold unfortunately because of the high competition in this years' ICLR.

The final scores for this submission are borderline, but the reviewers seem to agree on the positives (the contributions of the dataset itself) while the authors have gone through great lengths to address criticisms in terms of number of algorithms compared, the size of the dataset, the ability of the dataset to generalize to the real world, and the writing quality. Reviewer MHDH was also very thorough to catch an unintended overlap of train and test data, which the authors corrected. Taken as a whole, I believe the authors have done a great job addresses the perceived weaknesses of the manuscript and dataset. I also believe it is not obvious that deep methods would generalize from passive to active stereo (a concern of reviewer MHDH), so I believe this is a worthwhile study.

Gold Metareview 438:
The paper worked on fully unsupervised anomaly detection and proposed to use self-supervised representation learning to improve the performance of one-class classification. This is a borderline case close to acceptance but cannot make it. Specifically, it is useful, but its novelty is the main issue, since it is not surprising that self-supervised representation learning can improve one-class classification without representation learning (this part is still much of the taste of ICLR) and an ensemble of multiple models can improve upon a single model (which is just "bootstrap aggregating" or "bagging" used everyday in practice and known to machine learning and statistics societies a very long time ago). After seeing the rebuttal, the concerns were not really addressed well and the issues were only partially solved. Thus, the paper is not enough to guarantee an acceptance to ICLR unfortunately.

This paper has some interesting ideas and is an incremental improvement over previous work. However, it needs further revisions and polishing. The relation to prior work is a bit unclear. Since you mention POMDPs, what would be an equivalent version of your method in POMDPS? Why not compare your algorithm with a state-of-the-art method for small discrete problems? It is also a bit unclear why training a model to predict beliefs would be faster than just calculating them (after all the data must come from somewhere)..

The paper proposes a discretization of Wasserstein gradient flow with an euler scheme, and propose a way to estimate each step of the euler scheme using ratio estimators from samples regularized with gradient penalties. Statistical bounds are given to bound the estimated flows from the wasserstein flow.  

Reviewers have raised concerns regarding the assumptions under which results present in the paper hold, this was clarified by the authors (goedesic lambda convexity, log sobolev constant for the target density . lipchitizity of velocity fields).  The paper needs a revision to incorporate that feedback and to be in shape for publication. 

Other concern were on earlier claims in the paper regarding the monge ampere equation and approximation of the optimal mapping this was addressed by the rebuttal. 

Other concerns were also on explaining the relation of the work to score based models and energy based models. 

Overall the paper needs to state in a clearer way the assumptions for the theoretical results and to acknowledge the limitations of those assumptions in analyzing the euler scheme.

Gold Metareview 445:
This work defines the new problem of lifelong few-shot language learning where the goal is to continually learn new few-shot tasks and use those to benefit future tasks while not forgetting previous tasks. With larger models, this is an important goal due to the cost of updating and retraining these models. The work also shows superiority to existing approaches like EWC and MAS. After the author's rebuttal, the experimental section is also thorough with evaluation on a good range of tasks and approaches such as adapters showing good results. While this setting appears simpler than the full lifelong-learning setting and the approach combines existing ideas, this work's contribution to the definition and thinking about this problem is valuable. However, the authors should more clearly state the advantages of their approach vs standard prompt tuning (with an emphasis of benefiting future tasks) since two reviewers seem caught up on this point. The other two reviewers comments were addressed by the rebuttal as they stated in their comments.

This work is clear, very original, however it lacks a bit of significance and is more of a proof of concept. Here are the pros and cons I've identified.

Pros :
- This work deals with physics-based deep learning which is a very recent subject and one of growing interest for the medical community.
- Results on simulated data look promising.
- The theoretical part and the implementation is clear, too bad the code is not shared.

Cons :
- The responses to the reviewers are very dense, often repeat the same explanations from one reviewer to another and lack relevance. It is not clear what has been changed in the manuscript in particular.
- The proof of concept should have been to support in the claims of the authors, as well as the use of simulated data in the title as suggested by the last reviewer
- In order to make the work more robust and quantitative, different physical models could have been considered, different Resnet architectures and an application to real data.

This work is extremely interesting but still a little immature. So I suggest an acceptation as a poster.

 This paper proposes a compression method for Transformer-based encoder-decoder or language models . The key idea of the proposed method is to decompose the standard parameters into a much smaller shared parameters . Potentially a great paper, but if so it deserves to be much better explained . The proposed model, called DictFormer, has a smaller number of parameters and uses a smaller amount of computational operations . When evaluated against these models on popular machine translation, the model achieves comparable or better performance .
Gold Metareview 449:
DictFormer is a method to reduce the redundancy in transformers so they can deployed on edge devices. In the method, a shared dictionary across layers and unshared coefficients are used in place of weight multiplications. The author proposed a l1 relaxation to train the non-differentiable objective  to achieve both higher performance and lower parameter counts.

All reviewers ended up giving the paper a score of 6 after increasing their scores during discussions. While the results are strong (better performance at much lower parameter counts), the paper is not clearly written. Several reviewers noted that the paper is difficult to understand and has a few unresolved points. For example, the method also ended up performing better than the base transformer model that DictFormer is supposed to compress. There seems to be a lack of understanding about what part of the model delivered the improvements. One reviewer said that this is potentially a great paper that deserves to be better explained. The basic concept of sharing a dictionary across layers should be simple enough to explain well and deserve a better explanation than eq 5. 

The authors promise to release the code, which would be necessary for a full dissemination of this work. I recommend accept.

 It appears to be that the paper only considers linear function approximations? I am wondering why such limitations are imposed . I am not familiar with off-policy evaluation literature, however, in offline RL, DNN-based methods are effective . The writing quality is generally good . The main issue with this framework is the motivation for data poisoning . The empirical evaluation can be improved by introducing a more sophisticated strawman . The novelities are somewhat limited from the modeling side .
Gold Metareview 450:
Meta Review: This work proposes a data poisoning attack for off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods. It also shows that several popular OPE methods are not robust to data poisoning attacks. The reviewers were all positive on this work, recommending strong accept, accept, accept, and weak accept. They praised the generality of the proposed problem and framework.

One main criticism that arose in several of the reviews was a lack of a stronger baseline comparator. In their response, the authors pointed out the challenge of identifying a suitable baseline, given a lack of previous work in data poisoning for off-policy evaluation. In an attempt to provide a suitable baseline, they developed their own comparator, namely a variant of the Fast Gradient Sign Method. They then showed that their main proposed framework outperforms this comparator. In my view, this response adequately addressed this reviewer critique.

The reviewers also made a number of other relatively minor comments and suggestions, and the authors addressed these in their replies.

Gold Metareview 453:
This paper presents a new graph neural network layer that is sensitive to topological structure in the graph. Reviewers all believe the work is technically sound, and the experiments (particularly after author revisions) show clear benefits in cases where topological structure is important. The main questions are about whether the experimental evaluation is sufficient. While there are always more experiments that could be run, I tend to agree with the authors that the chosen experiments support the key claims in the paper, so it seems ok. The other question about the experiments is if they sufficiently convince the reader that topological structure is useful in practice. This seems more mixed. The paper would certainly be improved if there was a motivating application where there was a clear win. For example, molecular structures are used as motivation in the intro, but the best performing method on proteins doesn’t use the topological layer. All-in-all, though, there does appear to be clear improvements on carefully constructed cases, and there appear to be some benefits in real-world datasets.

The covered topic is timely and of potential impact for many application domains, such as drug design. The paper is well written and presentation is clear. The proposed approach seems to have some degree of originality. Experimental results seem to be generally good, and in the rebuttal the authors have provided further experimental support to their main claim.  There are however some issues that have not been solved by the author’s rebuttal. I think two of them are the most important and related: 

i) significance of contribution: although the authors have tried in the rebuttal to explain how the proposed approach differs from related papers, it seems that there are still doubts about the amount of innovation introduced by the paper. This issue could have been mitigated by SOTA experimental results in presence of a proper model selection, that, however does not seem to be the case here (see next point);

ii) model selection: the authors did not clearly explain the model selection procedure in the rebuttal. This is an important issue since it is often easy to get good results by picking the best run a posteriori. Unfortunately in the literature there are highly cited papers where model selection is not performed in a proper way and reviewers very often reject papers just looking at numbers without looking at how the numbers were obtained. So, I believe it is important to accept only papers where model selection is properly done and properly explained, so to allow for reproducibility of experiments.

 The paper deals with explainable machine learning in the supervised setting .

The high-level idea of the paper is promising, i.e. evaluating interpretability without the need for human-labelled groundtruth, which is tedious and expensive to collect .
Gold Metareview 455:
The reviewers all found that the Consensus method introduced seemed sensible and applauded the authors on their extensive experiments.  However, clearly they struggled to understand the paper well and asked for a clearer and more formal definition of the methods introduced.  Unfortunately, the highest scoring review was also the shortest and also indicated issues with clarity.  It seems like the authors have gone a long way to improve the notation, organization and clarity of the paper, but ultimately the reviewers didn't think it was ready for acceptance.  Hopefully the feedback from the reviewers will help to improve the paper for a future submission.

 This paper presents a new model for unsupervised event detection . It proposes individual criterion and mechanisms to detect expected and unexpected observations based on the comparison of prior and posterior latent representations .

Gold Metareview 458:
The paper analyzes diffusion-based deep generative models (DDGMs). The paper postulates that a DDGMs can be divided into two parts, a denoiser and a generator. 

After the rebuttal and discussion period, three out of four reviewers supported acceptance of the paper. The reviewers aLmZ, QKfo, and 4jY9 all find the interpretation of a diffusion-based deep generative model as a decomposition of a generator and denoising part interesting. Those reviewers also note that this interpretation is useful as parts of the diffusion steps can potentially be replaced with a VAE, which would make the synthesis more efficient.

The reviewers aLmZ and QKFo also note that one comparison is perhaps slightly unfair in that the number of parameters of the two models considered was different; the authors cleared this up with new simulations showing that matching the number of parameters (as should be done for a better comparison) does not substantially change the conclusions of the experiment. 

Finally, reviewer s9uB finds the approach and observations not to be novel and states that similar observations have been made in a recent CVPR paper by Benny and Wolf. While both the paper by Benny and Wolf and the paper under review study denoising diffusion models, the approaches taken by the two papers are substantially different, and both provide value to the community.

I also find the interpretation of the DDGMs as a denoiser and generator to be interesting and useful and therefore recommend acceptance of the paper.

The paper proposes a framework of Symbolic Reward Machine (SRM), an extension of Reward Machine (RM), for specifying interpretable and explainable reward functions. Then, a Bayesian IRL method is proposed to concretize an SRM using expert demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SRMs in terms of training efficiency and generalization. The reviewers acknowledged that the problem of inferring symbolic rewards is important and that the proposed SRM framework is an important step in this direction. However, the reviewers pointed out several weaknesses in the paper and shared concerns, including (a) limited comparison with alternate approaches to tackle the problem and positioning w.r.t. the existing literature; (b) the domains seem rather simple since they require only a few demonstrations (implying that the holes being inferred might be quite small); (c) the novelty and theory around the SRM representation is not fully clear. I want to thank the authors for their detailed responses. Based on the reviewers’ concerns and follow-up discussions, there was a consensus that the work is not ready for publication. The reviewers have provided detailed feedback to the authors. We hope that the authors can incorporate this feedback when preparing future revisions of the paper.

Gold Metareview 460:
This paper proposes a method for neural architecture search (NAS) based on adversarial methods. It uses a discriminator trained to distinguish between random vs. good architectures, letting the discriminator's scores serve as a reward signal for an autoregressive generator. I agree with AR1: this is a nice and clever idea. Reviewers generally agreed that the method was interesting, e.g. it's quite flexible in that it's able to incorporate constraints, and that the evaluation is rather extensive and shows that the method performs well across the board. Many minor criticisms were raised and addressed well by the authors in their responses and manuscript updates.

The major criticism shared by most reviewers was the high methodological complexity of the proposed approach, and the proportionally small gains shown over much simpler baselines. This criticism remained despite the authors' responses. The method is indeed complex: the same method without any adversarial component already performs well, and many important details of the model are relegated to Appendix A.2. (I would recommend, for example, moving Fig. 2 to the main text if at all possible. Also, the Appendix can/should be included in the main PDF for ICLR, rather than in supplementary material, as AR1 mentions.) It was not clear to reviewers that the adversarial component of the approach has a significant benefit. The authors respond by pointing to Table 7 showing that the discriminator reduces the number of queries and points out that in reality these queries correspond to expensive evaluations. If this is a major selling point of the method (it sounds like it could be), it should be highlighted and analyzed far more -- at least moved to the main text rather than an Appendix -- ideally with a real-world evaluation showing a practical large improvement in overall wall-clock time, rather than a benchmark where these evaluations are free. Perhaps the exclusive reliance on these benchmarks, though undoubtedly useful for quick experimentation, in the end holds back the paper and prevents the method's benefits from becoming apparent to the readers.

As a minor point (also raised by AR1), the paper is formatted incorrectly for ICLR: the font color is off, and more importantly the PDF is unsearchable (text cannot be selected, ctrl-F does not work), which makes it very difficult to quickly reference and review. Please try not to stray from the conference-provided style file for future submissions.

I appreciate the cleverness of the method, the extent of the evaluation, and the thorough responses to the reviews. However, unfortunately with the current presentation, it is too difficult to discern the benefit of the proposed approach from the manuscript. The approach is nonetheless intuitively appealing and seems quite promising, and I hope the authors will take the reviewers' good feedback into account and resubmit the paper in the future.

 The manuscript describes a decision-tree learning approach to clustering time series / plans . The splits at each node in the tree are done based on LTL formulae that separate the set of plans at that node into two subsets while optimizing an information-gain measure . The authors never mentioned that their approach is, in fact a decision tree . The paper did a good job motivating the need for a LTL-based contrastive specification .
Gold Metareview 461:
The paper presents a decision-tree approach for clustering plan traces and delineate them using linear temporal logic.

Both reviewers agree that the paper is well-written, it tackles a very interesting problem, and the technical methodology is sound. However, the reviewers also indicate two major problems with the paper: 1) the connection to XAIP is unclear; and 2) the work appears to be preliminary and incremental. Generally, the paper’s topic concerns plan summarization, which falls within the umbrella of XAIP, and a preliminary/incremental work is within the scopes of a workshop program. As such, in light of keeping the workshop a fruitful venue for discussion and dissemination of information, I am recommending accepting the paper.

Nonetheless, we urge to authors to reflect on the reviewer’s comments and address them in their revised version of the paper. Specifically, we hope the authors make a clear connection of their method to XAIP. Additionally, as the proposed approach builds heavily on the BayesLTL framework, the authors should include an overview of that framework and also explain the novelty of their approach compared to BayesLTL.

 The authors present an accelerated first-order method for the optimization of smooth and (strongly or not) geodesically-convex functions . They use "projected Riemannian gradient descent to implement an inexact proximal point operator" The writing and flow are excellent but only provide a very high level idea of the work and contributions of the current paper . My main concern is the metric projection oracle and the resulting comparison results with existing methods .
Gold Metareview 462:
The paper deals with accelerated methods on Riemannian manifolds. A particular challenge that the paper tries to address, which the AC believes is important, is related to the bounding of the iterates. The paper starts with an explicit bounding constraint on the manifold (and relaxes to the ball constraint for certain manifolds) and shows that the proposed algorithm can respect that while achieving acceleration. The reviewers including this AC see the merits of the paper. However, the paper in its current form is far from complete. A particular concern is on the empirical performance of the algorithm, resolving which should strengthen the paper. I would encourage the authors to build on the discussions and polish the paper accordingly.

Even though the paper has positive scores, the paper in its current form is a borderline paper with significant scope for improvement. To this end, the AC cannot accept the paper.

 A paper proposes a method whereby a neural network is trained and used as a data structure to assess approximate set membership . Unlike Bloom filter, the Neural Bloom Filter learns both the Write function and the Read function . The approach sounds promising, but the exposition is not clear at all . The proposed approach relies on "meta-learning", apparently to facilitate online training and/or learning across multiple sets arising from the same distribution . I think there's simpler ways to derive a continuous, differentiable version of this .
Gold Metareview 463:
This work proposes and interesting approach to learn approximate set membership. While the proposed architecture is rather closely related to existing work, it is still interesting, as recognized by reviewers. Authors's substantial rewrites has also helped make the paper clearer. However, the empirical merits of the approach are still a bit limited; when combined with the narrow novelty compared to existing work, this makes the overall contribution a bit too thin for ICLR. Authors are encouraged to strengthen their work by showing more convincing practical benefit of their approach.

 CyclesGym is a new benchmark environment for reinforcement learning (RL) applications to agriculture and farming . The benchmark allows for different crops to be produced over a span of multiple years . The simulator is a kind of wrapper around the software Cycle, one of many CGM that can be used for simulation of crop growth and crop rotation . A more open system with easier configuration options (e.g­. Weather, Location, Crop) could provide an interesting benchmarks environment for RL in agriculture .
Gold Metareview 464:
This proposal introduces CylesGym, the first Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmark targeted at long horizon decision making in agriculture. Crucially, while prior work addresses single-year decision making, CylesGym captures the long term effects that one year's crop has on future generations. 

The benchmark is clearly highly relevant and opens up a new frontier for RL researchers, making it a valuable contribution to the field. Furthermore, the benchmark does a good job of highlighting interesting opportunities for RL method development, such as costly information gathering, and evaluating current algorithms compared to baselines. 

There was an active discussion between the reviewers and authors of the benchmark which resolved the majority of issues raised in the initial reviews. As a result there is broad support across the reviewers for the paper. A lingering concern is the sim-to-real gap which is mentioned at a number of places in the paper but could be emphasised more. 

Lastly, the paper is well written and the evaluation sound. I believe this benchmark will be welcome by the community but I recommend that the authors address the concerns regarding the writing raised by  Reviewer MEYG, in particular regarding the utility for the agriculture community. In general I do not believe that issues which can be addressed in writing should be a reason to reject but those concerns should be addressed for the final version.

The proposed base KGQA model is modified from the state-of-the-art model on SimpleQuestions .

Gold Metareview 465:
This paper studies the problem of simple question answering over new, unseen domains during test time. A domain adaption framework and a seq2seq question generation method have been proposed to tackle this problem and demonstrates significant improvements over the previous baselines.

All the reviewers agreed that this paper is well-written and the results are convincing, but the problem is relatively narrow with a focused contribution.  Several reviewers also questioned whether this paper contains enough technical contributions. Some other issues have been already addressed during the discussion phase (long tail relations, presentation issues, and adding more related work).

However, we recommend accepting the paper considering the simplicity and effectiveness of the approach. We think it would lead to more discussion/future work in this direction.

 This paper describes experiments that inject linguistic information into BERT, then measure improvements in correlation with FMRI measurements of humans reading an underlying sentence . Linguistic information is incorporated by biasing attention heads to line up with dependency structures . The injection of structural information is done through fine-tuning of the models by "guided attention" The authors map the brain activity to each of the representations via a regression model, and measure the correlation by using correlation between the predicted (from brain activity) and actual output of the alternative models .
Gold Metareview 466:
This paper explores the effect on decoding accuracy (predicting hidden representations from fMRI datasets) from fine tuning models by injecting structural bias.  This paper specifically focuses the attention of BERT on syntactic features of the text, which (for one dataset) appears to improve the decoding performance.  The paper's motivation is strong, and complex concepts are communicated clearly.

The review period was very productive.  There were some questions about analyses, and the validity of the statistical tests, but through some very thorough back and forth with the reviewers, this seems to have been resolved.  There is a good amount of analysis done on the resulting language models to try and determine the impact of finetuning or attention on the models. However, the results on the fMRI two datasets appear to be very different, and it's unclear why (and isn't clearly related back to the extensive language model analyses).  We would have liked to have seen a more thorough analysis of the stark difference in performance, and some convincing explanations for the difference based on the analyses.  


P.s. A minor point, but the Wehbe paper uses Chapter 9 of Harry potter, not chapter 2.

Gold Metareview 468:
This paper proposes an extension of CTC by considering the wild-card to adjust the label missing issues during training. The authors propose to minimize the loss over all possible sub-segments of the input to automatically align the one that matches the available transcript. It is empirically proved to significantly improve performance over CTC even if up to 40-70% label sequence is missed (overall performance similar to the complete label case) across different tasks. 

As agreed by the reviewers, the paper is well presented and the problem is interesting to a broad community. Dynamic time warping with unconstrained endpoints itself is not a new idea and a classical topic for speech recognition (e.g. word spotting). The contribution of the paper is the formal introduction of the approach to CTC and to give experimental results to confirm the effectiveness. Also the use of simulated data weakens the paper a bit.

The decision is mainly based on the clear presentation and fair experimental justification.

This paper proposes to use a Lanczos alogrithm, to get approximate decompositions of the graph Laplacian, which would facilitate the computation and learning of spectral features in graph convents . It further proposes an extension with back propagation through the Lanczos algorithm, in order to train end to end models .

The reviewers unanimously agreed that the paper was a significant advance in the field of machine learning on graph-structured inputs. They commented particularly on the quality of the research idea, and its depth of development. The results shared by the researchers are compelling, and they also report optimal hyperparameters, a welcome practice when describing experiments and results.

A small drawback the reviewers highlighted is the breadth of the content in the paper, which gave the impression of a slight lack of focus. Overall, the paper is a clear advance, and I recommend it for acceptance.

 A paper attempts to learn embeddings for objects based on their affordances i.e., verbs that could be applied to them to realise their meaning . Empirical results show that these embeds allow prediction of a “mental representation” of objects . A qualitative analysis attempts to show how interpretable the objects are . The main problem I have with the paper as it stands is that it's not clear what the overall goal of the work is .
Gold Metareview 471:
This paper is a computational linguistic study of the semantics that can be inferred form text corpora given parsers (which are trained on human data) are used to infer the verbs and their objects in text. The reviewers agreed that the work was well executed, and that the experiments comparing the resulting representations to human data were solid. The method employed has little or no technical novelty (in my opinion, not necessarily a flaw), and it's not clear what tasks (beyond capturing human data) representations could be applied to (again, not a problem if the goal is to develop theories of cognition). 

The first draft of the work missed important connections to the computational linguistics literature, where learning about 'affordances for verbs' (referred to as 'selectional preferences') has long been an important goal. The authors did a good job of setting out these connections in the revised manuscript, which the reviewers appreciated. 

The work is well executed, and should be commended for relating ideas from different sub-fields in its motivation and framing. But my sincere view is that it does not meet the same standards of machine-learning or technical novelty met by other papers at this conference. It is unclear to me what the framing in terms of 'affordance' adds to a large body of literature studying the semantics of word embeddings, given various syntactically and semantically-informed innovations.  It feels to me like this work would have been an important contribution to the literature in 2013, but given the current state of the art in representation learning from text and jointly learning from text and other modalities, I would like to have seen some attempt to incorporate these techniques and bridge the gap between the notion of affordance in text/verbs (selectional preference) and Gibson's notion of object affordance (what you can do physically with an object) in experiments and modelling, not just in the discussion. Such a programme of research could yield fascinating insights into the nature of grounding, and the continuum from the concrete, which can be perceived and directly experienced, to the abstract, which must be learned from text. I encourage the authors to continue in this direction. An alternative is to consider submitting the current manuscript to venue where the primary focus is cognitive modelling, and accounting for human, behavioural data, and where there is less emphasis on the development of novel methods or models.

For these reasons, and considering the technical scope of related papers in the programme, I cannot fairly recommend acceptance in this case.

The submission proposes new theorems showing the stability of a class of RNN's . Theoretical results constitute an evolutionary step in the understanding the conditions of stability . Some claims are backed up by only a single data point .
Gold Metareview 473:
In the context of recurrent neural networks, the motivation of the paper is to explore the "space" between fully trained models and almost not trained models, e.g. echo state networks, using a formal approach. In fact, a modular approach has proven to be very successful in many practical applications, and in addition brain seems to adopt this strategy as well. The addressed theoretical issue is stability of the network (i.e., the network implements a contraction map.) Specifically, it is assumed that a network is composed of a set of subnetworks that meet by construction some stability condition, and the problem is to design a mixing weight matrix, interconnecting the latent spaces of the subnetworks, able to give stability guarantees during and after training. Some novel stability conditions are proposed as well as two different approaches to design a successful mixing weight matrix. The original submitted paper was not easy to read, and after revision major problems with presentation have been resolved, although the current version looks more like an ordered collection of results/statements than a smooth and integrated flow of discourse. The revision has also addressed some concerns by reviewers on the role of size and sparsity of the modules, as well as the sensitivity of the stabilization condition on the mixing weight matrix has been experimentally assessed, obtaining interesting results. Overall the paper reports interesting results, however the novelty of the contribution seems to be a bit weak, e.g. stability conditions on recurrent networks (although different from the reported ones) were already presented in literature. Also the idea of exploiting, in one of the proposed models,  the fact that the matrix exponential of a skew-symmetric matrix is orthogonal to maintain the convergence condition during training, is not novel. Moreover, the experimental assessment does not provide a direct comparison, under the same architectural/learning setting, of the novel stability results versus the ones already presented in literature. Empirical results are obtained on simple tasks (using datasets with sequences of identical length), and relatively small networks, which limits a bit the scope of the assessment, as well as it is not clear if the observed improvements (where obtained) are statistically significant (especially when compared with results obtained by networks with the same order of parameters.) The quality of the assessment would increase significantly by considering datasets with sequences of different lengths, and involving more challenging tasks that do require larger networks.

 The paper proposes the novel idea of using contingency awareness to aid exploration in sparse-reward reinforcement learning tasks . They obtain great results on hard exploration Atari games and a new SOTA on Montezuma’s Revenge . The choice of extra loss functions is not very well motivated . The core idea consists in identifying controllable (learned) features of the state, which in an Atari game for instance corresponds to the position of the player-controlled character .
Gold Metareview 475:
The paper addresses the challenging and important problem of exploration in sparse-rewards settings. The authors propose a novel use of contingency awareness, i.e., the agent's understanding of the environment features that are under its direct control, in combination with a count-based approach to exploration. The model is trained using an inverse dynamics model and attention mechanism and is shown to be able to identify the controllable character. The resulting exploration approach achieves strong empirical results compared to alternative count-based exploration techniques. The reviewers note that the novel approach has potential for opening up potential fruitful directions for follow-up research. The obtained strong empirical results are another strong indication of the value of the proposed idea.


The reviewers mention several potential weaknesses. First, while the proposed idea is general, the specific implementation seems targetted specifically towards Atari games. While Atari is a popular benchmark domain, this raises questions as to whether insights can be more generally applied. Second, several questions were raised regarding the motivation for some of the presented modeling choices (e.g., loss terms) as well as their impact on the empirical results. Ablation studies were recommended as a step to resolving these questions Reviewer 3 questioned whether the learned state representation could be directly used as an additional input to the agent, and if it would improve performance. Finally, several related works were suggested that should be included in the discussion of related work.

The authors carefully addressed the issues raised by the reviewers, running additional comparisons and adding to the original empirical insights. Several issues of clarity were resolved in the paper and in the discussion. Reviewer 3 engaged with the authors and confirmed that they are satisfied with the resulting submission. The AC judges that the suggestions of reviewer 1 have been addressed to a satisfactory level. A remaining issue regarding results reporting was raised anonymously towards the end of the review period, and the AC encourages the authors to address this issue in their camera ready version.

Gold Metareview 481:
Strengths:
Paper uses an efficient inference procedure cutting inference time on intermediate frames by 53%, & yields better accuracy and IOU compared to the one recent closely related work.

The ablation study seems sufficient and well-designed. The paper presents two feature propagation strategies and three feature fusion methods. The experiments compare these different settings, and show that interpolation-BMV is indeed a better feature propagation.

Weaknesses: Reviewers believed the work to be of limited novelty. The algorithm is close to the optical-flow based models Shelhamer et al. (2016) and Zhu et al. (2017). Reviewer asserts that the main difference is that the optical-flow is replaced with BMV, which is a byproduct of modern cameras.  R3 felt that there was Insufficient experimental comparison with other baselines and that technical details were not clear enough.

Contention: Authors assert that Shelhamer et al. (2016) does not use optical flow, and instead simply copies features from frame to frame (and schedules this copying). Zhu et al. (2017) then proposes an improvement to this scheme, forward feature warping with optical flow. In general, both these techniques fail to achieve speedups beyond small multiples of the baseline (< 3x), without impacting accuracy.

Consensus: It was disappointing that some of the reviewers did not engage after the author review (perhaps initial impressions were just too low). However, after the author rebuttal R1 did respond and held to the position that the work should not be accepted, justified by the assertion that other modern architectures that are lighter weight and are able to produce fast predictions.

This paper is truly borderline. On one hand, the theoretical contribution seems novel and interesting, however, there appears to be somewhat of a gap between theory and practice. 

There is unfortunately another problem. According to the authors, the main contribution of this publication is arguably the introduction of the nearest neighbor as the positive example in the triplet loss. However, the authors seem to be unaware of the history of the triplet loss. It was originally introduced by Schultz & Joachims 2004 as a loss over all triplets.  Weinberger et al. 2005 changed it and use the nearest neighbor as "target neighbor", which is called "easy positives" here, as the objective of LMNN. In 2009 Chechik et al. subsequently relaxed this positive neighbor formulation to any similarly labeled sample (going back to the Schultz & Joachims formulation) but sampling triplets. The re-introduction of the nearest neighbor as "easy positive" was then covered by Xuan et al. 2020.  

Unfortunately all of this diminishes the novelty significantly and it is clear that the paper in its current form does not have a strong enough contribution. I do encourage the authors to take a close look at the original LMNN publication and Xuan et al and write an improved re-submission for the next conference that maybe focuses more on the theoretical contribution. 
Good luck,

Generated Summary 487:
 The paper discusses the notion of "approximate value equivalence" in model-based reinforcement learning . The submission looks technically sound and the core ideas are well-explained . The presentation is very clear, well-organized, and several of the results are quite intuitive . The article is not self-contained, in the sense that most of the less intuitive results are presented with no hint on the proof . However, I do have a few major and (mostly) minor questions on the quality of the paper .
Gold Metareview 487:
A key discussion point in the rebuttal phase was the practical use of the proposed bounds, which two of the three reviewers brought up. The authors in response added an additional section (Section 6) and experiment to address this concern. While some concerns regarding the practical use of these bounds remain, the authors have made a sufficiently convincing case in my view. Hence, I recommend acceptance.

Generated Summary 488:
 The work presents a CLEVR-based compositionality benchmark . It is explicitly few-shot, which forces the models to generalize very quickly and to infer under uncertainty . The novelty of the dataset as a whole is limited, as it is effectively a modification of CLEVR . The authors also design several out-of-generalization data splits that test models' ood generalization performance . A good metric for the generalization gap that can measure how difficult each data split is by using oracle models .

This paper was reviewed by 3 experts in the field. The reviewers raised their concerns on lack of novelty, unconvincing experiment, and the presentation of this paper, While the paper clearly has merit, the decision is not to recommend acceptance. The authors are encouraged to consider the reviewers' comments when revising the paper for submission elsewhere.

 This paper proposes an way to incorporate task information into multi-task learning (MTL) The hope is that more explicit knowledge of task information will improve MTL, especially in cases where the model seems to confuse tasks . The results in Table 2 and Table 3 look promising but the presentation would benefit from more analyses experiments . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . It proposes task adaptive parameters by modulating model parameters to account for differences in tasks .
Gold Metareview 489:
This paper proposes an approach for improving MultiTaskLearning by providing a way of incorporating task specific information.

Pros:
1) All reviewers agreed that the paper is clearly written
2) Interesting to see a single model for AST, STS (speech-to-speech translation) and MT 

Cons:
1) The work is not adequately compared with related work (some important references are also missing) - The authors did perform some additional experiments with T5  and pointed out some drawbacks but this needs to be explored a bit more.
2) The answers about scalability are not very convincing and need more empirical results. 

Overall, none of the reviewers were very positive about the paper and felt that while this is a good first attempt, more work is needed to make it suitable for acceptance. 

Generated Summary 490:
 The work addresses an interesting problem that is relevant for full-scale automation of deep learning . It is difficult to argue for generalisability of this work as currently this work relies on one algorithm to find the optimal combination of regularisers . The study is formulated as hyper-parameter optimization task, heavily using Auto-Pytorch library . After rebuttal, the paper has been refocused and now sells itself as a way of deep neural networks being competitive versus gradient boosting methods .
Gold Metareview 490:
The paper in its most recent version claims that deep neural networks, when very carefully regularized, outperform methods such as Gradient Boosting Trees on tabular data. This is genuinely surprising to me (in a good way), and I suppose it is as well to the community.

The paper initially received negative reviews with two key remarks that "The results are somewhat expected." (R4, R3, R2). Indeed, the original version mainly stated that very careful regularization helps on tabular data.  Naturally, the reviewers (including myself) seen then as the second key weakness that "All experiments are run on tabular data." (R4, R3).

Based on the reviews, the Authors have clarified and changed their message. I think it is well summarized by R2 "The paper has been significantly refocused and now sells itself as a way of deep neural networks being competitive versus gradient boosting methods, which are dominating the tabular heterogeneous tasks."

As R2 said and was reflected in comments by other reviewers, "[...] convinced by authors response on paper novelty, technical contribution and (after the re-focusing) potential usefulness to the community".

Given the new message of the paper, a key new question surfaces. Is this indeed the first convincing demonstration that deep learning can outperform more standard methods on tabular data? R2 pointed out TabNet (see also Google Cloud offering) that already in 2019 claimed "beating GB methods for the tabular data". There is also NeurIPS work "Regularization Learning Networks: Deep Learning
for Tabular Datasets"; their abstract opens with "Despite their impressive performance, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) typically underperform Gradient Boosting Trees (GBTs) on many tabular-dataset learning tasks. We propose that applying a different regularization coefficient to each weight might boost the performance of DNNs by allowing them to make more use
of the more relevant inputs". The latter work did not claim to beat GBT. Regardless, the two works should be carefully discussed and compared empirically to in the new version of the work. 

I am also not yet fully convinced by the added comparison to GDBT. Arguably, AutoML from the sklearn package is not the most popular way to use GDBT in practice. How would regularization cocktails compare to GDBT from XGBoost, optimized using either random search or bayesian optimization?

Based on the above, I have to recommend the rejection of the paper. The key reason is: *the new reframing of the paper is exciting but warrants a much more detailed and careful evaluation*.

I really appreciate the work the Authors have put in clarifying and changing the message of the paper. I understand this is disappointing that we won't be able to include the work in ICLR. Nevertheless, I hope that the Authors found the feedback useful, and wanted to thank the Authors for submitting the work for consideration in ICLR.

 This paper introduces an additional objective to GAN training called “difference departure from normality” that is meant to encourage correlation between real and generated samples projected into some subspace . This is intended to prevent instability during training . The technique is applied to audio spectrogram generation . The proposed conditioning is based on limiting the generator from departing normality function of real samples, which is computed in the spectral domain of Schur decomposition . Figure 1 is only shown for US8k dataset only .

The paper proposes a trick for stabilizing GAN training and reports experiment results on spectrogram synthesis. All the reviewers rate the paper below the bar, citing various concerns, including a lack of clarity and unconvincing results. Several reviewers suggest conducting evaluations in the image domain as most of the GAN training techniques are proposed in the image domain. After consolidating the reviews and rebuttal, the area chair finds the reviewer's argument convincing and would not recommend acceptance of the paper.

Generated Summary 492:
 The authors propose a measure of compositionality in representations . Tracking compositionality could pave the way towards representations that facilitate transfer learning and better generalization . The name of the measure is a bit misleading and not justified by the data and data . The results are generally intuitive and reasonable enough to be credible as indicators of how compositionality relates to aspects of learning, while providing some potential insight . The main limitation to the conclusions that can be drawn from these experiments lies in the necessity of committing to a particular composition operator .
Gold Metareview 492:
This paper presents a method for measuring the degree to which some representation for a composed object effectively represents the pieces from which it is composed. All three authors found this to be an important topic for study, and found the paper to be a limited but original and important step toward studying this topic. However, two reviewers expressed serious concerns about clarity, and were not fully satisfied with the revisions made so far. I'm recommending acceptance, but I ask the authors to further revise the paper (especially the introduction) to make sure it includes a blunt and straightforward presentation of the problem under study and the way TRE addresses it.

I'm also somewhat concerned at R2's mention of a potential confound in one experiment. The paper has been updated with what appears to be a fix, though, and R2 has not yet responded, so I'm presuming that this issue has been resolved.

I also ask the authors to release code shortly upon de-anonymization, as promised.

 This paper introduces an MCMC algorithm for private parameters by augmenting the parameters space with the private date . They propose an MH and Gibbs sampling type sampler that updates unobserved variables and parameters . Strengths: It is an interesting problem- it is easy to follow . Weakness: Experimental results are not enough and do not comprehensively back up their claims . Comparison to other MCMC-based privatized methods is required . The aim is to enable Bayesian inference that can capture the DP induced noise .
Gold Metareview 493:
This paper presents a general MCMC algorithm for approximating the joint posterior distribution of model parameters and private data, given output from a differentially private algorithm. The paper provides new tools for Bayesian inference under privacy constraints, which can be useful for the differential privacy community. There are a few suggestions from the reviewers/discussion. First, even though the authors claimed their results are fully general, they should consider toning it down or at least clarifying upfront their "Record Additivity" assumption, which seems non-trivial. As one of the reviewers remarked, one of the limitations of this approach is that it will not scale well with high-dimensional data. The AC suggests the authors add this limitation in the discussion of the paper.

Other comments:
While not critical, the AC also has a question regarding the following part:
- In line 105: the assumption is that the density of the mechanism's output distribution is known. This has nothing to do with what privacy variant you use to analyze the mechanism.

 This paper addresses challenges faced in the multi-task learning (MTL) models used in analyzing multimodal conversational data . The main challenge paper is on how to select relevant auxiliary tasks that avoid negative transfer . The authors explore how the preprocessed data used for feature engineering can be re-used as auxiliary tasks in the model . The primary tasks (4-classes emotion classification using the same 4 emotions, and dimensions prediction) are very close to these auxiliary tasks .
Gold Metareview 494:
The initial reviews for this paper were very borderline. The authors provided detailed responses as well as a few additional results and observations. The authors' responses answered the reviewers' questions and addressed their main comments (including in the discussion of related works as well as with more in-depth analysis in a new Section 5.1). Unfortunately, the reviewers did not come to a consensus.

Overall, this paper extends some current methodology for emotional classification, is well-executed, and provides a reasonably thorough study. The results are somewhat in line with previous results from other fields (and notably NLP), but the authors demonstrate the efficacy of using primary multi-task learning for multimodal conversational analysis. 

Unfortunately, this paper also has some flaws as highlighted by the initial reviews. As stated above, the authors did provide a strong rebuttal, but given the different comments raised by the reviewers that spanned many aspects of the paper including motivation, possibly limited contribution and novelty, missing related work, somewhat shallow analysis of the results, I find that another full round of reviewing would be useful to assess the paper.

As a result, this remains a very borderline paper, and given the strong competition at this year's conference, I cannot recommend acceptance at this stage.

I suggest that the authors incorporate some of the discussions from this forum (and especially with respect to related work, new findings, and clearly defining the motivation and contribution of this work) into the next version of their paper.

 This paper presents a model to determine word embeddings by composing morpheme embeddeddings . This is important research that mixes pre-existing knowledge and corpus-derived knowledge . It is unclear how this model generalizes . This paper introduces a new word embedding compression method with morphological augmentation . The authors compare their method to several compression techniques and show that even with a 40x compression ratio, the proposed embedsings are on par with the baseline .
Gold Metareview 495:
The paper presents a method to compress word embeddings using morphologically-enhanced tensorized embeddings. The main idea is decomposing a word embedding into a tensor product of multiple small vectors. This idea has been explored in previous work [1], the main contribution of this is using *morphological segmentation*, aiming to capture morphological features. 

The proposed method is compared to prior work on multiple tasks (machine translation, qeustion answering, etc), overall exhibiting strong performance in terms of compression rate & performance (though sometimes gains are pretty smaller compared to Word2ket (e.g., Table 2)). 

During the discussion phase, the authors provided the results with random, non-morpholgically inspired segmenation, which was useful. I’d recommend putting them into the main paper. Experimenting on morphologically rich languages (e.g., Finnish) would be useful. As well as sensitive study towards hyper parameters (e.g., dimensionality of morpheme embeddings) which can easily impact the compression rate & performance. 

Overall, the reviewers and AC is positive about the paper.

Two of the initial reviews of the paper were mildly positive (2 scores of 6), and one was very positive (score of 8). However, these reviews failed to notice some severe issues with the paper, which were detailed by the Area Chair in an Extra Review which was provided late. The severe issues include: clarity of exposition (undefined notation in many places) and theory (vacuous or meaningless theorems and assumptions). I apologize to the authors for not having had the chance to defend against this late review. However, the issues are indeed severe.

 The authors report on a technique to address learning rate hyperparameter tuning for deep learning referred to optimizer grafting . The paper proposes a meta-algorithm that blends the steps of two optimizers by combining the step magnitude of one (M) with the direction of the other (D) The technique allows for the transfer of the overall implicit step size schedule to a new optimizer, resulting in reductions in computational cost . Using grafting, they discover a non-adaptive learning rate correction to glyglySGD which allows it to train a BERT model to state-of-the-art performance .
Gold Metareview 498:
The paper proposed Trained ML oracles to find the decent direction and step size in optimization. The process they call grafting. Reviewers raised several concerns about the reliability of ML oracles in general settings which is valid. The rebuttal could not convince the reviewers to change their opinion.  Ideally for an empirical only paper with heavy reliability on ML for critical decisions, to meet the high bar of ICLR there must be several experiments (5-10 datasets or more) on diverse datasets and settings. Also, there should be discussions on when and how the method fails and related discussions. In that sense the paper does not meet the bar for publication.

 The proposed DRL method does answer to the main motivation, which is to reduce inference time . The authors report comparable performance to a conventional method while being much faster . The results are a bit too short, e.g., there is no visualization of resulting paths . It also appears to be a modified re-implementation without much detail provided . The approach is 10x faster than the state-of-the-art and yields significantly better results .

The work describes the use of RL for trajectory planning for minimally invasive liver tumor ablation. The main motivation is that RL can accelerate planning over conventional methods.

Strengths according to reviewers:
* Interesting problem.
* Relatively well written.
* Good description of RL methodology. 
* Interesting results (comparable performance to conventional method, faster inference)
* Uses public database, which may facilitate reproducibility and comparisons in future work.


Weaknesses:
* Limited novelty with respect to machine learning. Main contribution is rather the idea of using RL to improve the specific application.
* Not extensive evaluation.

Initial reviewer concerns regarding weak motivation and clarity were addressed to a significant extent, improving the manuscript, which is reflected to the increased ratings after rebuttal. 

After a very productive rebuttal and discussion period, accompanied with significant updates to the paper, there seems to be a concensus that the paper is of acceptable quality for a publication in MIDL.

 Distance Map Layers (DML) can be used as the one just before the final layer in a neural network for classification . DML is mainly used to improve the diversity of predictions from the ensemble members . The experiments are extensive and really promising . The authors should pass this paper through someone that can do the edits to fix the grammatic and typo errors that seem glaringly glaring . This paper proposes to use the distance map layers for ensemble-based defense by randomly choosing the centers to vary over classifiers .
Gold Metareview 500:
The paper proposes a method to improve adversarial robustness by diversifying the ensemble. 

Novelty: As pointed out by several reviewers, promoting diversity of ensembles has been done in the literature, but there's still a moderate novelty in proposing the DML layer. 

Empirical validations: The original submission lacks many important comparisons (e.g., with [1]). Despite the authors implicitly compared their method with (Pang et al) via Auto-attack in the rebuttal, it will be better if the comparisons are conducted in a well-controlled way to confirm that the improved robustness comes from DML instead of other hyperparameter settings. Further, it is not clear whether the proposed method is robust to hyperparameters. 

Based on these, we recommend rejection but encourage the authors to improve their paper based on the comments.

 The theory of g-identifiability is an important concept for the field of causality and it is important to get it right . The paper addresses a crucial flaw in the proof of the soundness of the algorithm of the general identifiability problem of Lee et al. 2019 . There were some small parts that were difficult to follow or where the readability could be improved . The potential for relaxing this assumption for their algorithm is not discussed or considered .
Gold Metareview 501:
Meta Review: In this paper, the authors revisit recent work (Lee et al., 2019) on identification of interventional distributions from a set that may include the observed data distribution and/or a set of interventional distributions.  (Lee et al., 2019) proposed a sound and complete identification algorithm for that problem.  The authors point out a critical flaw in that work: the completeness proof relies in a crucial way on absence of positivity.  However, absence of positivity (even including relaxations of positivity proposed by Shpitser and Pearl) results in the proposed algorithm not being sound, as the authors convincingly illustrate with examples.  The authors provide a repair of the algorithm proposed by (Lee et al., 2019), with new soundness and completeness proofs.

The reviewers were unanimously positive about this paper, and their questions were answered by the authors to their satisfaction.  Some reviewers pointed out that in addition to repairing a critical flaw in a recent paper, this work will also encourage authors in the causal graphical modeling community to pay more careful attention to important issues related to positivity or "overlap" assumptions.

 This paper studies the communication complexity (bits communicated) of distributed optimization problems . It provides lower bounds for these problems and first-order algorithms with appropriate compression/decompression .

I like the paper but have some questions/concerns, due to which I have currently weakly accepted the paper .
Gold Metareview 502:
This paper considers the following problem in distributed optimization: To train an overparameterized model over a set of distributed nodes, what is the minimum number of bits required to reach zero loss. The paper gives lower bounds on the bit complexity for two settings: non-convex functions satisfying a PL condition and overparameterized quadratics. The authors then give an algorithm that (1) for PL objectives, has optimal communication complexity (up to logarithmic terms in the dimension of the problem) and (2) for quadratic overparameterized objectives, attains optimal communication complexity (up to logarithmic terms) with high probability.

This paper generated significant discussion in the initial author-reviewer discussion period. Most of the reviewers were quite positive on the paper, and found the results to be interesting and relevant to the community, and found the paper to be well-written. They found the results, which provide near-optimal sample complexity for two settings (PL functions and overparameterized quadratics) to be technically strong, and were impressed by the tightness of the results. One reviewer took issue with certain limitations of the paper, including:
- A limitation of the lower bounds in the paper is that they concern only deterministic methods.
- The results are only tight with respect to the parameters $D$, $N$, and $\epsilon$, and are not necessarily tight with respect to $L$ and $\mu$.
- Some related work can be discussed in more detail.

These limitations do not seem to take away from the novelty, and neither I nor the other reviewers were convinced by the other issues raised in the discussion. As a result, I believe the paper is worth accepting as a starting point for future research in this direction. Nonetheless, the authors are encouraged to expand the discussion around these issues and limitations in the final version of the paper, as well as expand the comparison to related work.

 The goal of fair ranking is to find a ranking of top-$n$ items such that the utility with respect to $W_{ij}$s is maximised under the constraint that the ranking obeys the limits imposed by $U_ij$s . The authors introduce an approximation algorithm to solve the fair ranking problem and prove that it approximately satisfies the considered fairness criteria . The proposed approach is the most fair of all baselines and achieves the best tradeoff between utility and fairness .
Gold Metareview 503:
This paper looks at the fair ranking problem, a known variant of ranking where group fairness constraints (typically hard, sometimes soft) are imposed on the traditional ranking objective, but where membership of each item to be ranked in a group (aka the sensitive attribute's value associated with that item) is unknown.  The paper provides strong theoretical results and, especially post-rebuttal, strong experimental backing of the setting at hand.  Some assumptions are relatively strong, as surfaced by reviewers (e.g., 3sFW), but by and large reviewers believed the work to be well motivated and complete, and I agree with that.

 The authors propose a 3-phase heuristic algorithm to learn a causal graph from interventional data using continuous optimization . Unfortunately, the paper is hard to follow . The exact procedure should be clarified by the authors . The proposed method is not a systematic approach . The authors suggest an iterative method that builds on the widely accepted do-formalism . The approach fits the network before interventions, simulates the intervention on the fitted network and assigns a likelihood score to the network parameters .
Gold Metareview 504:
In this paper, the authors study how to incorporate experimental data with interventions into existing pipelines for DAG learning. Mixing observational and experimental data is a well-studied problem, and it is well-known how to incorporate interventions into e.g. the likelihood function, along with theoretical guarantees and identifiability. Ultimately there was a general consensus amongst the reviewers that without additional theoretical results to advance the state of the art, the contribution of this work is limited.

 The paper investigates whether new vision transformer based models are capable of detecting near OOD samples . The conclusions of the paper seem very preliminary and are hard to judge without information about the respective models predictive performance on the classification task . The authors present positive results on the ability of transformers to detect OOD . However, the authors do not present a positive result on whether transformers are able to detect . No new methodological development is presented in this paper .

It appears as if both reviewers found some positive aspects and adapting and evaluating known techniques for OOD detection with either transformers or standard CNNs. The results are considered to be not exactly exciting and more work would be required to come to a more insightful conclusion. In summary I believe the paper is not yet quite ready for publication and could be further improved for a future date.

The experiments and results are clearly presented with some helpful color-coding to aid the process . The authors do a great job evaluating the performance quantitatively and qualitatively .
Gold Metareview 506:
The paper proposes to treat object-centric models with iterative refinement procedures as fixed point operations and optimize them using implicit differentiation.

Overall, the reviewers find that the contribution of the paper is somewhat novel, although similar ideas have been presented in prior work in different contexts (supervised settings). Only one reviewer was more negative before the rebuttal, eventually increasing their score after discussion with the authors.

I, therefore, recommend acceptance and encourage the authors to address the comments raised by the reviewers in the final version.

 This paper contributes an end-to-end multi- module architecture that learns design concepts from CAD sketches . The greatest weakness of the current paper is the lack of explicit evaluation on the learnt design concepts . The authors proposed a method to decompose CAD sketches into sub modular concepts, for design intent parsing . The goal is to discover sketch concepts from raw sketches in the format of sketch graphs . The proposed method also is capable of auto-completion for CAD modeling .
Gold Metareview 507:
As summarized by reviewer 5G2f, this paper proposes a novel learning-based approach to discover the modular concepts (i.e., modular structure) from raw CAD sketches. To tackle the problem, the authors first define a domain specific language (DSL) such that modular concepts can be represented in a network-friendly manner.

A Transformer-based detection module takes in a CAD sketch sequence and outputs a a set of latent embeddings, which are further decoded to parameterized modular concepts by a generation module. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end self-supervised manner, using reconstruction loss plus regularization terms.

The authors perform experiments on a large scale CAD sketch dataset and mainly demonstrate its applications for design intent interpretation (i.e., parse modular concepts from a raw CAD sketch) and auto-completion (i.e., complete a partial CAD sketch).

All reviewers recognize the novelty and contribution of this work, and the reviewer-author discussion was quite fruitful as many points, ranging from designer/user interaction, comparison to baseline methods, and issues with the library size are discussed and addressed. With such clear contribution and applicability to the CAD domain, I highly recommend the acceptance of this work.

Meta Review: The paper proposes a novel quantitative measure for risk in RL. The measure is sensitive to aleatoric and epistemic risk, and avoids some theoretical issues with previously proposed additive measures of the two types of risk. The paper also proposes a novel risk sensitive RL algorithm (based on ensemble bootstrapping and distributional RL). The method performs well empirically.

Pro:
* All reviewers agree that the proposed measure and algorithm is novel, sound, and original. 
* 3 out of 4 reviewers agree that the paper is well written. 
* The topic of risk sensitive RL is timely and important - 3 out of 4 reviewers rate the potential impact as good (3).
* Empirical results justify the theoretical claims and the method performs well compared to other distributional RL methods

Con:
* In their initial assessment, reviewers point out minor technical flaws and some difficulties in understanding parts of the empirical evaluation. The authors have commented on the issues raised, but only 1 reviewer has responded to the authors' comments.
* PeBL points out a potential shortcoming w.r.t. the training protocol (splitting the data). Authors acknowledge this and point to other papers in the literature using a similar protocol.
* The method seems somewhat complicated and could perhaps be presented better - this is based on questions raised by reviewers, and these questions should be helpful for the authors to improve the camera-ready presentation.

**Justification of recommendation:** 3 of 4 reviewers are in favor of accepting the paper. The only (weakly) negative reviewer has raised some major issues that are answered in the appendix of the paper (but the reviewer did not find the appendix) and answered in other sections of the paper (as pointed out by the authors). To me, the authors have adequately addressed all major and most minor comments in their extensive response (including the major issues raised by the negative reviewer) - unfortunately only the most positive reviewer responded to the rebuttal. Taking all this information together I can still confidently recommend acceptance of the paper.

With this quantification of safety, the paper then demonstrates the computation of this deviation for interpretable models like trees and generalized additive models . The safety metric is the maximum of outputs deviation between the target model and the reference model for some input sets . The paper also motivates how such reference model along with certification dataset might be chosen depending on the problem .
Gold Metareview 512:
The authors propose to inspect learned models based on their maximum deviation to a reference model. They evaluate the feasibility of computing this deviation for a number of widely used model classes, including generalised linear models and decision trees. The idea is illustrated in cases studies. 

Reviewers all appreciated the novelty and importance of the proposed problem and the contributions made to examine the feasibility of solving it. Their main concerns were regarding the limited discussion on choosing the reference model and the certification set. The authors expanded greatly on this in their rebuttal and in a revision to the paper. 

The technical novelty is rather lower but the paper should not have trouble finding an audience in the NeurIPS community due to the broad applicability of the problem under consideration the clarity of the manuscript. I think the added discussion asked for by reviewers is well within what could be expected to be added for a camera-ready version (and indeed, this is already in the Appendix of the revision).

 The authors identify an interesting empirical phenomenon: across a range of network architectures and training approaches, the feature spaces identified by these networks are similar . The hypothesis of converging feature spaces is interesting, but the conclusion from the current experiment results is overstretching . The authors didn't measure $E$ so the readers won't know how well the top-1 dimensional subspace represents the feature matrix . The paper explores a new question and gives some interesting conclusions . But my major concern is its empirical studies cannot support the findings well .

This paper presents an intriguing empirical phenomenon in deep learning. They train a variety of architectures for different tasks using different datasets and study the relationship between the learned representations. In particular they collect the representations into a large matrix and take the top left singular vector and measure the cosine of the angle. They show that it is much smaller than one might expect, about 10 degrees or so, and has an approximate monotonicity property as the network is being trained although it does not seem to converge to zero. Moreover this measure also correlates with performance. 

The reviewers had divided opinions on this paper. On the one hand, the range of experiments is impressive and truly demonstrates that this is a pervasive phenomenon. On the other hand, it is not so clear what it means. In particular, suppose we have a collection of graphs which have close to the same degree distributions. If we take the top left singular vectors of all the adjacency matrices, they would also have low angles between them. While this is a very different setting and there is no analogy between the experiments in this paper and this toy model, it does raise philosophical questions about whether the phenomenon is meaningful or is a byproduct of something else about the data. This may be a challenging question to answer, but one reviewer brought up a natural next step: One could measure the principal angle between the subspace of the top k left singular vectors across experiments for larger values of k. The authors do bring up the point that the spectrum decays very quickly, so it could be that beyond a certain point the singular vectors behave somewhat randomly.

 The paper proposed an algorithm to learn a non-uniform pruning policy for compressing the deep neural network and maintaining good performance under adversarial attacks . Pruning policy is learned by reinforcement learning where each state is the parameter features of each layer, i.e., convolutional kernel sizes, and the action space is the range for compression ratio . With the learned policy, the paper shows that they can achieve consistent improvement for both clean images and perturbed images .

 This study curates and annotates the ProteomeTools Dataset, a proteomics dataset that can be used to train models in predicting properties for mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using experimental data . The paper highlights an area of research that is not as commonly represented in CS/ML conferences . The primary weakness of the paper is the relatively limited original content . An annotated dataset does not only lower the entry difficulty in training such models, but also provides an standardized way to train and compare them .
Gold Metareview 516:
Reviews were split. Reviewers agreed on the importance of the domain but differed in how they valued the contribution over ProteomeTools, which the dataset builds upon. A primary concern was lack of baselines/benchmarking. The rebuttal argues that baselines would not add much value since strong methods have been published in prior work. However, my interpretation of the reviewers ask is not to invent new heuristic baselines but to evaluate the prior methods on the newly prepared dataset. The authors do add evaluation of one such model (Prosit) to the revision. Evaluating more models in the same way could strengthen the contribution, and could be part of the ongoing maintenance of the dataset / code.

Overall, however, the majority of reviewers felt the paper does provide significant value beyond ProteomeTools and other prior work, through the new annotations, tooling, and usage recommendations. The revision adds an appendix (G) to clarify these contributions, and it may be useful to move some of that text into the intro of the paper (as I think many readers will want to know what are the main contributions beyond the base dataset). I agree with the majority that there is significant value added and recommend acceptance.

 This paper studies three instances of the multi-objective RL problem, namely smooth concave scalarization, CMDPs, and max-min trade-off . The authors proposed a new class of algorithms for these problems which updates a regularized objective which constrains the KL between the update policy and some anchor policy . The resulting algorithm achieves global convergence with exact gradients . The main technical contribution is an anchor-changing regularized natural policy gradient framework .
Gold Metareview 517:
This paper studies multi-objective RL, and in particular the settings of smooth concave scalarization, constraints, and max-min trade-off. The authors propose a framework for these problems called “anchor changing regularized natural policy gradient” (ARNPG) and show $O(1/T)$ convergence with exact gradients. The results do not require some of the assumptions used in related works such as ergodicity. The authors evaluate their approach on tabular environments, Acrobot, and (post-rebuttal) Hopper.
The paper is well-written, the results seem correct, and the work provides a nice extension of the recent results on PG convergence to the multi-objective case. This contribution warrants acceptance despite the somewhat limited empirical evaluation.

The paper presents a new evaluation dataset for machine translation, focusing on sampling test examples that can effectively rank different systems. The evaluation set contains a wide range of language pairs (35 language pairs) and shows a higher correlation with human judgments than original, unfiltered datasets.

The paper also includes in-depth analysis, such as what kind of sentences are getting filtered, and how it connects to human paraphrasing. My initial concern about using same models to compute variance and then to evaluate output was addressed during the rebuttal period.

 The strength of this paper is the extensive and detailed toy and benchmark experiments . This paper studies the problem of how to fine-tune a pre-trained model and obtain better results for both ID and OOD . The authors refer to this method as LP-FT and show it often outperforms LP and FT both OOD and FT . It is not well known that fine tuning (FT) outperforms linear probing (LP) ID)
Gold Metareview 521:
The paper provides a solid and thorough analysis to the two basic methods of fine-tuning, linear probing (LP) and fine-tuning (FT). The authors provide an important and highly interesting observation about the performance of both in and out of domain (OOD) setting. They validate the known phenomena that FT outperforms LP in the in-domain (ID) setting, but demonstrate that when tested on OOD data, LP is in fact more performant and back this observation with a theoretical and empirical analysis.
The remedy provided is also a known, yet slightly less popular technique of setting the final layer (LP) first, then finte-tuning (FT-LP). The authors provide thorough experiments showing that this technique enjoys the best of both worlds, meaning ID and OOD. I found it worth noting that during the rebuttal period the authors provided experiments on additional larger scale datasets and models and the results of the paper carried over to these new setting.
The reviews agree that the analysis provided is both interesting and novel. Even though the paper does not provide a new technique, there is a consensus that the understanding it gives on known techniques is a welcome addition to ICLR.

 A paper proposed a single image-based manipulation method (DeepSIM) using conditional a generative model . The editing effects of edge maps are not distinct from those of segmentation maps . The authors need to clarify why the VGGNet-based perceptual loss encourages the model to maintain the fidelity . This work explores a way of conditioning the generation on a primitive, which can be user-specified . One can produce realistic modifications to a given image by modifying - or sketching - some primitive .
Gold Metareview 523:
The reviews are a bit mixed. While all the reviewers feel that the paper proposed an interesting mechanism to train conditional generators from a single image and demonstrated good image editing results in the experiments, there are also common concerns about the practicality of the proposed method for interactive image editing. All the reviewers asked for the computation time, and some expressed the concerns about technical contributions. While these concerns were (somewhat) addressed in the rebuttal, the AC feels that it’s a hard sell to bet on the dramatic increase of computational capacity to make the computing time from an hour to realtime. Concerns about novelty also remained. Given the drawbacks, the final decision was to not accept. However, this work is promising and can be made stronger for publication in a later venue.

 The paper addresses how to learn policies for tasks in which constraints are specified in natural language . It proposes a model that encodes the different types of natural language constraints into intermediate representations that model spatial and temporal information between states . They also propose a new benchmark (Hazard World) which is inspired by the 2D MiniGrid environment . The goal of the agent is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative rewards while satisfying the constraints given .
Gold Metareview 526:
The goal of the paper is to learn policies that can solve a given task while adhering to certain constraints specified via natural language. The paper closely builds upon prior work on constrained RL and passes the representation of natural language constraints by pre-training an interpreter. Experiments are done in a new proposed 2D grid-world benchmark. Although reviewers liked the premise, the main issue raised is that the way natural language constraints are handled is no different from the way it is done in prior work on constrained RL. The authors provided the rebuttal and addressed some of the concerns regarding paper details. However, upon discussion post rebuttal, the reviewers and AC feel that the paper does not provide clear scientific insight because the natural language part is processed separately from the policy learning part. We also believe that the paper will immensely benefit with results in more complex environments beyond the 2D grid-world. Please refer to the reviews for final feedback and suggestions to strengthen the submission.

Generated Summary 527:
 The authors provide an interesting new avenue for evaluating pruning methods, with the use of ground truth sparse networks . "Weak tickets" require training to perform comparably to the original network, while "strong tickets" do not . The motivation and the correctness of the lottery ticket planting are not clear to me . The empirical findings in this paper are already presented in the previous paper Frankle2021 . The winning ticket planting is quite interesting and can provide ground truth for pruning before training .
Gold Metareview 527:
This paper takes on (in my view) one of the most important questions in the lottery ticket literature today: how small are the smallest lottery tickets that exist in our neural networks? Many methods have been proposed for finding weak lottery tickets (those that require training to reach full accuracy) and strong lottery tickets (those that do not), but we have no idea how close they come to finding the smallest lottery tickets. Moreover, in many cases, we only know how to find lottery ticket subnetworks early in training rather than at initialization. Is this a fundamental limitation on the existence of lottery tickets, or is this simply a limitation of our methods for finding them? I am personally very involved in lottery ticket conversations in the literature, and I believe I can speak with some authority when I say that these are vital questions where any progress is important.

Moreover, these are exceedingly difficult research questions, and (again, in my view) the authors should be commended for taking them on. A naive approach to these questions would involve brute force search over all possible subnetworks, which is infeasible even on the smallest of toy examples, let alone the meaningful computer vision tasks where lottery ticket work typically focuses.

I am sharing all of this information to provide background for my confident recommendation to accept this paper over the many legitimate concerns expressed by reviewers and those that I saw when reading the paper in detail. Those include that:
* This paper does not solve any of these research problems in their entirety.
* It focuses on toy networks smaller than those traditionally studied in the lottery ticket literature, and it is well known that lottery ticket behavior changes in character at larger scales.
* Planting good subnetworks may be an unrealistic proxy for the kinds of subnetworks that actually emerge naturally.
* There may be multiple good subnetworks in a network, not just the one that was planted.
* The graphs are a bit hard to read.
* I find the mix of pruning methods studied, which were designed with very different goals (pruning after training, pruning before training, finding strong lottery tickets), a bit confusing.

**The bottom line:** With all of that said, in my view, the paper asks good questions and provides an initial foothold that other researchers will be able to build on as we seek more general answers. This is similar to the contributions made by Zhou et al., which started the conversation on strong lottery tickets, and potentially even Frankle & Carbin, which kicked off the lottery ticket discussion but got many things wrong. Both papers were good first attempts at solving big problems, and both were highly influential despite their flaws. Similarly, even if this submission isn't perfect in every way, this is among the most important kinds of contributions that a paper can make. For that reason, I strongly recommend acceptance under the belief that this paper will help to foster a valuable conversation in the literature.

P.S. I really, truly, strongly beg the authors to redo their graphs following the style of some of the more user-friendly lottery ticket or pruning papers they have cited (e.g., Frankle et al., 2021). The graphs in this paper were really hard to parse. Really really really hard to parse. They're too small, the y-axis is often squished, gridlines would be helpful, the lines are overlapping in ways that are difficult to distinguish because the colors blend, etc. etc. This is quite possibly the biggest impediment I see to this paper's ability to have broader influence.

The authors present a graph neural network for heterophilic data using gradient flows. The proposed architecture is quite simple...large sections of the architecture are fully linear dynamical systems rather than neural networks, and still achieve roughly SotA results on standard graph learning benchmarks. There was a significant amount of disagreement between the reviewers. Some seemed to think the strength of mostly linear methods meant that the benchmarks were too easy, but these are standard graph neural network benchmarks. A simple model performing well is not a negative, and can often be useful for puncturing hype (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13211). Simple architectures can also be useful for providing analytic insights which might get obscured in more complex models. Some reviewers seemed concerned about the scaling of certain tools (e.g. graph Laplacian eigenvectors), but these tools are only used for analysis, not for training. Nevertheless, I feel that there were enough general concerns around the paper that I have a difficult time recommending acceptance. Even if the purpose of the paper is primarily to drive analytic insights rather than achieve SotA results on big benchmarks, I would recommend the authors to show how these analytic insights can be used to improve models on big datasets to strengthen the paper.

 The paper investigates the over-parameterization of attention heads in Transformer’s multi-head attention .

This is called “collaborative attention” The paper is well-written and organized, the experiments are thorough, but I have several concerns .
Gold Metareview 535:
This paper proposes an interesting collaborative multi-head attention (MHA) method to enable heads to share projections, which can reduce parameters and FLOPs of transformer-based models without hurting performance on En-De translation tasks. For pre-trained language models, a tensor decomposition method is used to easily covert the original MHA to its collaborative version without retraining. 

This paper receives 3 weak reject and 1 weak accept recommendations. On one hand, all the reviewers agree that the paper is well motivated and the proposed idea is interesting. On the other hand, all the reviewers also commented that the current empirical results and comparisons are weak, which are not enough to support the paper's main claim. From the current results, it is difficult to draw a conclusion that collaborative MHA is better. 

Specifically, (i) From Table 2, it can be seen that the proposed method is not effective for pre-trained models, i.e., even if the model size is not reduced much, the performance can be dropped significantly. (ii) More experiments, such as QA, more translation/generated tasks will make this paper more convincing. (iii) More rigorous experiments are needed to justify the practical value of the proposed method. If the authors try to emphasize that they go beyond practical realm, then probably a careful re-positioning of the paper is needed, which may not be a trivial task. 

The rebuttal unfortunately did not fully address the reviewers' main concerns. Therefore, the AC regrets that the paper cannot be recommended for acceptance at this time. The authors are encouraged to consider the reviewers' comments when revising the paper for submission elsewhere.

This paper defines a truly unsupervised image translation scenario. Namely, there are no parallel images or domain labels. To achieve robust performance in this scenario, the authors use 1) clustering and 2) generator-discriminator structure to map images from different domains and generate images for target domains.  

In all, all the reviewers agree that this definition of unsupervised image translation is interesting. However, there are also several concerns for the real-world practical application and empirical results.  Unlike unsupervised text translation whose target language is known, the truly unsupervised image translation is difficult to make sense without identifying what is the target domain. This limits the contribution of this paper to some specific tasks instead of more general tasks. For the empirical results, the selection of data and the hyperparameter K do not convince the reviewers.

Somewhat borderline paper given the scores, but leaning on the side of accepting mostly because the positive (and weak positive) reviews are a little more persuasive. The negative review is a bit of an outlier; the main issues raised in the negative review are that the novelty is on the lower side or otherwise that the work is incremental. These complaints are largely not shared by the other reviewers, and furthermore seem not like deal-breakers. Still a borderline paper, but fairly safe to accept.

Generated Summary 541:
 This paper proposes an algorithm to alter the structure of a graph by adding/deleting edges so as to degrade the global performance of node classification . The motivation in using meta-learning to solve the bilevel optimization problem is not very clear to me . The complexity of the proposed method seems to be very high. The data sets used in the experiments are too small. The experimental results on three graph datasets show the proposed model could improve the misclassification rate of the unlabeled nodes .
Gold Metareview 541:
 The paper proposes an method for investigating robustness of graph neural nets for node classification problem; training-time attacks for perturbing graph structure are generated using  meta-learning approach. Reviewers agree that the contribution is novel and empirical results support the validity of the approach.

 This paper proposes a novel clustering technique that combines the self-organising map (SOM) and differentiable quantized clustering ideas of VQ-VAE . The resulting algorithm is able to achieve better unsupervised clustering than either technique on its own . This solution can have immediate wide spread real life applications, for example in medicine or finance . The goal is to learn a discrete two-dimensional representation of the data in an interpretable manner .
Gold Metareview 542:
This paper combines probabilistic models, VAEs, and self-organizing maps to learn interpretable representations on time series. The proposed contributions are a novel and interesting combination of existing ideas, in particular, the extension to time-series data by modeling the cluster dynamics. The empirical results show improved unsupervised clustering performance, on both synthetic and real datasets, compared to a number of baselines. The resulting 2D embedding also provides an interpretable visualization.

The reviewers and the AC identified a number of potential weaknesses in the presentation in the original submission: (1) there was insufficient background on SOMs, leaving the readers unable to comprehend the contributions, (2) some of the details about the experiments were missing, such as how the baselines were constructed, (3) additional experiments were needed in regards to the hyper-parameters, such as number of clusters and the weighting in the loss, and (4) Figure 4d required a description of the results.

The revision and the comments by the authors addressed most of these comments, and the reviewers felt that their concerns had been alleviated.

Thus, the reviewers felt the paper should be accepted.

 SuNCTt is a new loss designed to speed up convergence of semi-supervised training . The claim is that supervised contrastive learning can speed up representation learning . The improvement over SimCLR does not seem to be significant under the same training epochs . The paper is well-written and easy to understand . The proposed SuNCEt loss is turned off after some training episodes and does not significantly improve the accuracy .
Gold Metareview 543:
The paper proposes to speed-up self-supervised learning for semi-supervised learning by combining self-supervised pretraining and supervised fine-tuning into a single objective. The proposed supervised loss builds on Neighbourhood Components Analysis and soft nearest neighbor losses. Most reviewers are concerned about the novelty of the approach and the significance of empirical results. I agree with both concerns. I appreciate the comparison between $\log \sum \exp$ and $\sum \log \exp$, but it seems a simpler cross entropy loss also achieves a similar goal (potentially somewhat slower). I believe adding more experiments comparing different supervised loss functions across different architectures can help improve the paper.


Generated Summary 544:
 The paper aims to perform meta-learning across tasks that have different input data types by learning separate task-specific encoders . It is not clear from the abstract / introduction what is meant by “schema” The paper proposes a trainable way to re-order or recover the ordering of features from sets of examples, and use it as a way to build a common feature space (or embedding) for a neural net .
Gold Metareview 544:
After carefully going through the reviews and rebuttal, and looking at the content of the paper as well, I feel there are some issues with the current manuscript. As also pointed out by AnonReviewer5 and AnonReviewer2, the text lacks clarity. From specifically defining what a schema is, to being more explicit about the limitation of the work. 
I understand that the authors are interested in a largely unexplored setting, and hence there might not be a lot of prior work to cement the evaluation protocol. Particularly because of this I think such papers need to be upfront and clear not only in what is the setting and what is the evaluation but also what are the limitations and open problems. 

I do agree that there is value in this direction of research, and that the idea of re-ordering the features using attention (which I have to agree it is reminiscent of Bahdanau et al., ICLR 2015 -- though the semantics of it and its purpose makes it novel here) might be a way forward. But I do think for the paper to make an impact (and be ICLR ready) it needs more work both in the writing and maybe on the experimental side as well (consider some more complex task, or be more explicit on what is the common aspect between tasks in the distribution that can allow chameleon to work)

 The authors introduce a public dataset of stimulated Raman histology images of brain tumors (OpenSRH) The authors claim that this is the first dataset of its kind . This dataset includes over 1,300 whole slide images from 307 patients . Overall, this is an excellent and exciting contribution to the field . Using contrastive learning on a (frozen) computer vision model (head) significantly improves the classification accuracy of patch-level inference to (almost patient-level accuracy)

There are contrasting review rating ranging from 9 to 3. The reasonable concerns about this paper not been well validated for ML community. The proposed datasets has been benchmarked with some classical and some relevant DL methods. I have taken into account the expertise of reviewers and their concerns carefully. I do agree with some reviewers opinion about this dataset will be importance to medical CV community. I do agree with authors response "The open questions for the ML community that OpenSRH may foster innovative discoveries include the following: 1) domain adaptation between SRH images and other histology images such as H&E images in the large scale TCGA project; 2) using multiple instance learning (MIL) to avoid expensive dense patch annotations; 3) different aggregation methods for patch-based training, including clustering, attention, or MIL; 4) self supervised learning and comparing different augmentation strategies for SRH images; and 5) data efficient training of ViT architectures using SRH data. " Even though the authors have not verified these innovative applications on the openSRH dataset. I will go with acceptance opinion of few reviewers for this paper.

 This paper proposes a pluggable method that learns a dynamic prediction error bound for some error-bounded learned indexes . With the proposed method, the learned index can make a better trade-off between space and time . The paper presents a method to learn a variable error bound to use when building piecewise linear segments for learned indices for databases . An additional learned component is based on an estimation function that uses a sample to estimate the mean and the variance of the remaining data which will be covered by the next linear segment .

 This paper combines a widely used variance reduction technique SVRG with the greedy-GQ . It provides a finite-time analysis of the proposed algorithm in the off-policy and Markovian sampling setting (convergence to the stationary point) The paper is well written and clearly presented . The convergence rate in Theorem 4.5 is not for the . proposed algorithm . The nested loop structure seems at odds with the single Markovan path of experience . The reviewer strongly suggests the author to do so .
Gold Metareview 547:
**Overview** This paper provides a way to combine SVRG and greedy-GQ to improve the algorithm performance. In particular, the finite iteration complexity is improved from $\epsilon^{-3}$ to $\epsilon^{-2}$.

**Pros** The paper is well-written. Reviewers believe this is a solid theoretical work on advancing value-based algorithms for off-policy optimal control. It has sufficient theoretical advancement and experiments demonstrations of the methods. 

**Cons** Some reviewers are concerned that SVRG is not SOTA. SVRG is not used in practice. The techniques appear to be similar to some existing works. 

**Recommendation** The meta-reviewer believes that the paper has solid theoretical contributions. SVRG is a component in the new algorithm to improve the complexity. It does not need to be "useful" or "SOTA". The paper is also well-written. Hence the recommendation is accept.

Generated Summary 548:
 An algorithm to verify whether or not there exists an adversarial example in an Lp ball of size espilon around a given training sample . As opposed to previous similar algorithm (Geocert), it sacrifices completeness in order to gain efficiency . In addition, the authors explain how to take advantage of the Neural network structure to make the algorithm more efficient . The scalability to large networks seems to be an issue, although the proposed method significantly outperforms prior work .
Gold Metareview 548:
The paper presents a sound and efficient (but not complete) algorithm for verifying that a piecewise-linear neural network is constant in an Lp ball around a given point. This is a significant contribution towards practical protection from adversarial attacks with theoretical guarantees. The proposed algorithm is shown to be sound (that is, when it returns a result, that result is guaranteed to be correct) and efficient (it is easily parallelizable and can scale to large networks), but is not complete (there exist cases where the algorithm will return "I don't know"). The experiments show good results in practice. The reviewers are positive about the paper, and most initial concerns have been addressed in the rebuttal, with the paper improving as a result. Overall, this is an important contribution worth communicating to the ICLR community, so I'm happy to recommend acceptance.

Generated Summary 549:
 Machine learning systems often do not share the same inductive biases as humans and, as a result, may extrapolate in ways that do not match analyst's expectations . Authors propose a protocol to investigate the inductive bias of the learning system towards different features . The proposed protocol, which takes its ideas from psychology, is interesting . The paper proposes measures of how two types of explanation methods -- rule based and exemplar based -- generalize and extrapolate to unseen data regions .
Gold Metareview 549:
The paper proposes a novel protocol for examining the inductive biases in learning systems, by quantifying the exemplar-rule trade-off (as measured by the exemplar-vs-rule propensity (EVR) defined in Eq. (2)) while controlling for feature-level bias. 

Reviewers mostly agree that the problem studied in this paper is practically relevant and that the two bias measures are potentially interesting and (jointly) more informative than existing measures such as spurious correlation. However, a shared concern among the reviewers (with confidences scores >=3) is the clarity of the exposition (e.g., many key concepts such as the data conditions are informally specified [Section 2 (Reviewer TPBn)], some key messages not clearly conveyed in the main paper [Section 3 (Reviewer RJtk)], and results inconclusive or not sufficiently supported by the experimental results [for both the synthetic setting (Reviewer RJtk) and the real-world setting (Reviewer yoH5)]. Based on the above concerns, the reviewers were not convinced that this work is well supported in its current state to merit acceptance for publication.
