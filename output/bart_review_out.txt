Generated Summary 1:
This paper addresses a core issue of the popular conditional neural process. The predictions at each test point are conditionally independent given the conditioning set. This is an inappropriate modeling assumption for many real-world datasets. The authors propose to go beyond a non-diagonal Gaussian to describe the joint distribution. The main idea is to directly parameterize the mean and the covariance functions of a Gaussian predictive via neural networks. They also propose to use Copulae to handle non-Gaussian marginal distributions.
Gold Metareview 1:
This paper proposes a class of neural processes that lifts the limitations of conditional neural processes (CNPs) and produces dependent/correlated outputs but that, as CNPs, is inherently scalable and it is easy to train via maximum likelihood. The proposed model is extended to multi-output regression and to capture non-Gaussian output distributions. Results are presented on synthetic data, an electroencephalogram dataset and on a climate modeling problem. The paper parameterizes the prediction map as a Gaussian, where the mean and covariance are determined using neural networks. Non-Gaussian prediction maps are obtained using copulas. 

Technically speaking, the reviewers found the approach to be incremental and only marginally significant and I agree with them. Issues such as estimates of computational cost, using fixed lengthscales for the covariances and relationships/using normalizing flows have been addressed by the authors satisfactorily. Empirically, the contribution of the paper is somewhat significant, as it provides similar flexibility to other more computationally expensive processes and more general assumptions than conditional neural processes.

This paper proposes to study exploration at different levels of granularity. Current methods either explore at the level of individual steps (e.g., \epsilon-greedy) or at thelevel of experiments. This paper proposes the intra-episodic level, i.e. where the agent switches between exploration and exploitation within the same episode. It presents a large body of study results (10 pages of appendices!!), and concludes with very thought-provoking suggestions and discussions.

Gold Metareview 2:
Exploration can happen at various levels of granularity and at different times during an episode,  and this work performs a study of the problem of exploration (when to explore/when to switch between exploring and exploitation, at what time-scale to do so, and what signals would be good triggers to switch). The study is performed on atari games.

Strenghts:
------------
The study is well motivated and the manuscript is overall well written
Studies a new problem area, and proposes an initial novel method for this problem
extensive study on atari problems

Weaknesses
--------------
some clarity issues as pointed out by the reviewers
no illustrative task is given to give a more intuitive exposition of the "when to explore" problem
comparison to some extra baselines like GoExplore would have been insightful

Rebuttal:
----------
Most clarity issues have been addressed satisfactorily. It has been explained why some requests for extra baselines would be challenging/or not relevant enough. While the authors agree that GoExplore would be an interesting baseline, they seem to have not added it. An illustrative task was not provided.

Summary:
------------
All reviewers agree that this manuscript opens up and tackles a novel direction in exploration, and provides an extensive empirical study on atari games (a standard benchmark for such problem settings). While I agree with the reviewers that point out that this paper could have been made stronger by adding an illustrative task and additional baselines like GoExplore, there is a general consensus that the provided empirical study on this novel problem setting is a good contribution in itself. Because of this I recommend accept.

This paper proposes a method for learning graph-level representation in an unsupervised contrastive way. The approach partially builds upon contrastive self-supervised learning which contrasts pairs of augmented graphs. The major concern about this method is that it encourages the closeness of augmented views from the same graph instances. For example, if we drop an edge and that edge happens to be in a structural motif, it will drastically change the attributes/labels of the molecule.

This paper proposes an unsupervised graph learning method [Iterative Graph Self-Distillation (IGSD)] by iteratively performing self-distillation to contrast graph pairs under different augmented views. This idea is then extended to semi-supervised setting where via a supervised contrastive loss and self-training. The method is empirically evaluated on some semi-supervised graph classification and molecular property prediction tasks, and has achieved promising results.

Reviewers agree that the method is interesting and the paper is well-written. The biggest concern from reviewers related to experimental evaluations of the method. The authors responded to this and included additional experiments. Although the reviewers appreciate the provided results and explanations, at the end they were not convinced about the empirical assessments. In particular, R1's post rebuttal comment indicates concerns about the reported performance of GCKN, which is different from the published one in Table 1 of GCKN paper. I encourage authors to improve on these experimental discrepancies and resubmit.

The authors provide a compelling theoretical explanation for a large class of adversarial examples. They prove a number of theorems relating these scaling relationships to a broad swathe of relevant model architectures. The paper does not cover the adversarially-augmented training based iterative attacks. It is unclear how this specific gradient based analysis can help the understanding of the adversarial perturbation phenomena. Given that the experimental results are also not particularly novel, I recommend rejection.

Gold Metareview 4:
This paper suggests that adversarial vulnerability scales with the dimension of the input of neural networks, and support this hypothesis theoretically and experimentally. 

The work is well-written, and all of the reviewers appreciated the easy-to-read and clear nature of the theoretical results, including the assumptions and limitations. (The AC did not consider the criticisms raised by Reviewer 3 justified. The norm-bound perturbations considered here are a sufficiently interesting unsolved problem in the community and a clear prerequisite to solving the broader network robustness problem.) 

However, many of the reviewers also agreed that the theoretical assumptions - and, in particular, the random initialization of the weights - greatly oversimplify the problem. Reviewers point out that the lack of data dependence and only considering the norm of the gradient considerably limit the significance of the corresponding theoretical results, and also does not properly address the issue of gradient masking.

This paper studies the problem of learning to play a Nash equilibrium in two-player, zero-sum Markov games. The main algorithm is a version of the classic fictitious play algorithm. It operates on the Q-values, but a key novelty is the use of a particular form of regularization. The paper is well written but I did not check everything in detail. I’m also curious about the reduction of the presented algorithm to matrix game. And what can we say about the convergence rate of the algorithm?

The paper shows that a form of Fictitious Self-Play converges to the Nash equilibria in Markov games. Understanding the theoretical properties of Fictitious Self-Play is important, however the paper in its current form is not ready for publication. The paper needs a more thorough discussion on related works, the assumptions made, and as pointed out by Reviewer3, the convergence argument needs to be expanded and explained in more detail. Further, I encourage authors to add experiments and compare their algorithm with other methods.

The authors proposed a method for source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) task. The key idea is to combine the advantages of global alignment and feature consistency. The proposed method divides target samples into source-like and target-specific ones. Source-like samples are used for global class clustering. Target-specific samples are use for learning local structures. An adaptive contrastive learning strategy is used to achieve class-wise adaptation and local consistency.

This paper proposes a relatively complicated method for source-free unsupervised domain adaptation, which integrates several techniques into a divide and contrast framework. The idea of dividing the target data into source-like subset and target-specific subset and employing global alignment and feature consistency for each subset is novel when the source data is inaccessible. The contrastive learning and memory-based MMD are novel in the context of source-free domain adaptation and introduce theoretical benefits in terms of the expansion theory and domain alignment theory, respectively. Reviewers were on the positive side while holding some concerns on the marginal improvement over the SoTA methods, which were addressed in the author rebuttal. AC generally agreed that the paper has introduced a novel and solid contribution to the field, with a nice connection between algorithmic methods and theoretical insights, and  recommended the paper for acceptance. Authors are suggested to incorporate all rebuttal material in the revision and if possible, to work out a recipe for easing the adoption of their relatively complicated framework that comes with many modules and loss terms.

The paper puts together several ideas from prior works (partial rejection control/SMC, variational inference, dice-enterprise) Empirical experiments suggest that the method outperforms previous work. It is not obvious that one can obtain unbiased estimators of the normalizing constant. The experiments include a mix of toy and more realistic examples. The experimental results compare favorably to prior works like FIVO and IWAE and demonstrate that using partial rejection control is beneficial in a variety of benchmarks.

This paper explores the use of partial rejection control (PRC) for improved SMC-based variational bounds. While an unbiased SMC variant with PRC has been previously introduced by Kudlicka et al. (2020), this work introduces innovations that can help apply such ideas to variational inference. These bounds result in improvements in empirical performance. 

This paper was heavily discussed, with significant engagement by both the authors and the reviewers. Most reviewers recommended acceptance of this paper, with one reviewer (R4) recommending against acceptance. R4's central concerns regard the novelty of the proposed approach and its positioning relative to the existing SMC literature. The authors argued vigorously in the comments that this paper should be judged as a contribution to the VI literature and not the SMC literature.  Unfortunately, I will recommend that this paper is rejected. It is my opinion that R4's concerns were not fully addressed.

On the one hand, I agree with the authors that there is significant value to be had in exploring variants of SMC for VI. Indeed, some prior art, like FIVO and IWAE, contributed little to the Monte Carlo literature. I believe that these were good contributions.

On the other hand, I am concerned that the current draft does not clearly circumscribe its contributions. I read the sections that disuss the works of Schmon et al. (2019) and Kudlicka et al. (2020), and the writing did not leave me with a clear enough sense of the differences. I also read the abstract and introduction of the paper. The introduction of the paper positions this work clearly within the VI literature, but does not clearly discuss prior SMC art, e.g., it does not cite Kudlicka et al. (2020). Despite citing rejection control for SMC, the writing of the abstract and introduction left me with the impression that this work was the first to introduce *unbiased, partial* rejection control for SMC. I believe that impressions matter and that the machine learning community should be generous to adjacent communities when assigning credit.

I realize that my decision is a matter of taste. I also want to say that I am confident that the authors have a clear sense of where their contribution sits, and I suspect that it is a valuable contribution. However, I cannot recommend the draft in its current form. If this is a contribution to the VI literature, as the authors argue, then the authors should not hesitate to give full credit to prior SMC art. My reading of the current draft still leaves me confused about which aspects of the SMC estimator are actual contributions.

Gold Metareview 8:
This paper addresses a meta-learning method which involves bilevel optimization. It is claimed that two limitations (myopia of MG and restricted consideration of geometry of search space) that most of existing methods have can be resolved by the MBG with a properly chosen pseudo-metric. The algorithm first bootstraps a target from the meta- learner, then optimizes the meta-learner by minimizing the distance to that target under a chosen pseudo-metric. The authors also establish conditions that guarantee performance improvements and show that metric can be sued to control meta-optimization. All the reviewers agree that the idea is interesting and experiments well support it. Authors did a good job in the rebuttal phase, resolving most of concerns raised by reviewers, leading that two of reviewers raised their score. While the current theoretical results are limited to a simple case where L=1$, the method is attractive for meta-learning community. All reviewers agree to champion this paper. Congratulations on a nice work.

The way the paper is currently written, by interleaving background on existing methods, makes it hard to follow. The write-up is not very good and could besignificantly improved. The experiment section is missing many essential comparisons. The limits of 50s and 75s for bin packing seem very large. The paper presents two algorithms but many details are left out. This makes it impossible to understand how the algorithms work.

This work presents a novel environment-free invariant learning method that uses an auxiliary network to learn environment-specific features, from which environment inferences can be derived. The method is composed of two jointly learned models, that take care of the environment identification, the learning of the invariant representations, and the label predictions, produced by a multi-headed neural network. The proposed model is compared to different alternative models from the literature of the field, in different challenging benchmarks, and the results show that it closely achieves the best possible invariant learning performance.

After some initial discussions, all reviewers agreed that this work is ready for publication, as the work addresses an important problem, presents good empirical results, and will be of significant interest to the community.

I thank the authors for their submission and active participation in the discussions. This papers is borderline. On the positive side, reviewers emphasized this is a well written [ovqB,1zPe] and sound paper [BUDa] with good theoretical [td5N,ovqB,1zPe] and empirical [BUDa,td5N,ovqB] results. On the negative side, reviewers remarked clarity [KyZj,AVki], incremental with respect to Tasse et al (2020) [KyZj], relatively restricted Boolean task algebra [td5N], toyish nature of the environments considered [ovqB], and some missing details [1zPe]. During discussion, the sentiment seems to be somewhat lukewarm with none of the reviewers strongly favoring acceptance or rejection. It seems the main remaining concern is around the toyish nature of the environments used in this paper. I acknowledge that and I believe the authors could include experiments on more complex environments. However, I also give the authors credit for addressing most of the reviewer's concerns during rebuttal and for presenting a solid empirical and theoretical result that the research community can build upon in the future. I am therefore recommending acceptance of this paper and highly encourage the authors to further improve their paper based on the reviewer feedback.

I'm not totally convinced that the assumptions in this paper is general and realistic. I still have some concerns about the technical soundness.

This paper explores the performance of Q-learning in the presence of either one-sided feedback or full feedback. Such feedbacks play an important role in improving the resulting regret bounds, which are (almost) not affected by the dimension of the state and action space. The motivation of such feedback settings stems from problems like inventory control. However, the assumptions underlying the theory herein are often quite strong, which might limit the applicability of the theory. The dependency on the length per episode H can also be improved.

The reviewers highly appreciated the replies and the additional experiments. We also had a private discussion on the paper. To summarize: the replies alleviated quite a few concerns, however the consensus was that the paper still does not meet the bar for a highly competitive conference like ICLR.

The idea of combining MPC (on a 'wrong' model)  with a learned cost function is very interesting and a promising direction. On the downside the reviewers are still not entirely convinced about the contribution and believe that the paper requires a significant re-write to incorporate the discussed points as well as an additional round of reviews.

The paper surveys existing differentially private data synthesis
methods, and introduces an algorithm that learns both a generator and
a classifier in a differentially private mode.

The problem is highly timely and important. Results are promising.

Main remaining concerns after discussion between the reviewers and the
authors are:

- reason why the proposed scheme can give better classification
accuracy, should be clarified more

- unclarity on conclusions that can be drawn from the experiments. The
revised version has improved on this somewhat.

One explanation for the problems was suggested to be that the paper
tries, at the same time, to both present a new method and be a
survey. Is hard to do in a short paper, and as a result, the paper
lacks focus. At the very least, more work is needed.

The authors are encouraged to continue their work on this
important problem, and the review comments hopefully help in that.

This paper presents a method for unsupervised learning of disentangled representations by first training a VAE with a tangled set of latents, and then sequentially learning disentangled latent variables one at a time from the entangled initial VAE latent space. On several toy disentanglement benchmarks, the method is shown to perform competitively with previous VAE and GAN approaches. 

There were several concerns from reviewers around the clarity and description of the proposed one-factor-at a time (OAT) training procedure. While the updated draft addressed several typos and some clarity issues, multiple reviewers continued to find the method description problematic. There were additional concerns around the viability of the method on real-world datasets where the number of factors are not known, and as the authors stated the proposed method can also result in one factor of variation encoded into mulitple latent variables, which hurts on many of the disentanglement metrics.  The addition of CelebA downstream task evaluation begins to address this concern of real-world data, but more rigorous experiments (including more description of how models were selected) and discussion of the limtiations of the proposed method are needed. There is also no theoretical motivation as to why the proposed intervention-based factor learning algorithm should recover the ground truth factors.

Given the concerns over experimental results, clarity, and lack of theoretical motivation, I suggest rejecting this paper in the current form.

This paper presents a rich dataset aimed at creating supervision for 2D cartoon tasks. The dataset is created by procedurally converting open source 3D computer graphics movies/shorts into "flattened" 2D frames. Care is taken in describing both the motivation and limitations of this approach. In an area with a dearth of good data, this paper's contributions are warmly welcomed. Reviews appreciated these aspects of the paper while highlighting potential weaknesses that appear addressed in the revisions. I recommend accepting this paper to the NeurIPS 2022 Datasets and Benchmarks program.

Thank the authors for their submission.

The paper studies combinatorial multi-armed bandit with probabilistically triggered arms. That is an MAB setting in which, at each round, the learner chooses a subset of the arms and obtains a reward that is some function of expected rewards of the chosen arms. In addition, the learner only observes feedback on a random subset of her chosen arms (triggered arms). 

The paper relaxes a smoothness assumption laid by a previous work, and further improves the dependence on K in the regret bound, where K is the batch size (maximum number of triggered arms)
The authors provide computationally-efficient algorithms that are based on Bernstein concentration inequality, facilitating the improved bounds. 
The paper is well-written and organized, and the theoretical results are sound.

The paper is generally well-written, however, there is some confusion listed as follows. The goal of their training scheme is to create an ensemble of models that has a high disagreement on the out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in the unlabeled set. The success of the method largely relies on the models in the ensemble having sufficiently different outputs on OOD samples. Some claims are vague in the submission, for example, the authors claimed that the Maximum discrepancy method (MCD) tends to result in ensembles that do not disagree enough on Ood data.
Gold Metareview 24:
The authors propose a semi-supervised novelty detection method which tries to identify out-of-distribution samples in the unlabeled data (consisting of in- and out-distribution samples) using a disagreement score of an ensemble. The ensemble is generated by fine-tuning the trained classiifer on the labeled training data plus the unlabeled data which all get a fixed label (which is repeated several times to generate the ensemble). The main idea is that one uses early stopping based on an in-distribution validation set in order to avoid overfitting on the unlabeled points which allows then identification of the out-distribution points via the disagreement score.

The reviewers appreciated the simplicity of the approach and the extensive experimental results. The authors did a good job in trying to answer all questions and concerns of the reviewers. 

However, some concerns remained:
- the setting assumes that the OOD data is fixed which was considered as partially unrealistic and thus evaluation of the OOD detection performance on unseen OOD distributions was requested in order to understand the limitations of the method (this was only partially done by the authors). 
- the theoretical result is for a two-layer network and completely based on previous work. As the authors use much deeper networks later on in the experiments, this result cannot be used to theoretically justify the approach. 
- there remained concerns about the necessary diversity of the ensemble and the early stopping procedure

While I think that the paper has its merits, it is not yet ready for publication. I encourage the authors to to take into account the above points and other remaining concerns of the reviewers in a revised version.

This paper investigates the collapsing problem of contrastive learning. It attempts to attribute the collapsing phenomena to strong augmentation and implicit regularization, using simple linear network models. Based on the above analysis, the paper then propose a simple sub- vector based CL method called DirectCLR. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This paper shows that contrastive methods also suffer from the “dimensionality collapse” phenomenon. Two underlying causes for this problem are proved in simplified settings of shallow, linear networks.

The paper proposes an "ensemble" of autoencoders of varying depths and widths called RobOD. RobOD is competitive at outlier detection against other models, while being significantly more robust to the hyperparameter choices. The authors discuss that their method is costlier than a single training model. The proposed ROBOD seems to be simple and easy-to-implement, but enjoys both good effectiveness and efficiency against other AE-based baselines.

This paper empirically demonstrates the sensitivity of unsupervised OD methods to hyperparameters and proposes ensembles of models with differing hyperparameters along with training techniques based on weight sharing to do so efficiently. 

The authors provided additional experiments to answer some reviewer's major concerns regarding the (meta-)HP robustness of the ensemble methods. While there are natural fluctuations with respect to the (meta) hyperparameters, a larger number of hyperparameters included usually resulted in a close to optimal AUROC.

Another concern for two reviewers was the extendability of the efficient ensemble training techniques to other models such as GANs etc. As the authors replied, even though skip connections might not be adaptable to other techniques, e.g. for ensembling various widths, zero-masked layers with BatchEnsemble would also be broadly applicable to ensemble-learn other unsupervised representation learning models. Perhaps in the final version, the authors further discuss with a short experiment how the AE-specific scaling techniques add to the performance.

A further concern was the lack of theoretical underpinning about the (meta)HP-robustness. Given that the reviewers agree that this paper provides ample empirical evidence and praise the experimental value, we think theoretical work (providing HP sensitivity results is highly nontrivial in general, let alone for neural networks) can be part of future work but the lack of it in the current manuscript should not prevent the publication of this work.

This paper studies the last iterate rate of convergence of the well-known extragradient and optimistic gradient algorithms in smooth monotone games with continuous convex action sets. The main result of the paper is to show that both algorithms (with constant step size) enjoy tight last-iterate convergence rates for setting (previous papers either 1) only applied to unconstrained domains 2) were asymptotic, or 3) required dependence on arbitrarily large problem-dependent constants).

This paper resolves a well-known open problem within the min-max optimization community, and is likely to have significant impact.

The experiments show evidence of reward hacking as a function of modeling power of the agent and the size of the state-space. The authors also find ‘phase transitions’ where a small increase in capability results in qualitatively new reward hacking behavior. The paper concludes with some ideas and initial directions on how to potentially mitigate reward hacking.

The paper proposes a method for accelerating distributed high-dimensional regression under sparsity constraints. The method combines Nesterov’s proximal gradient with consensus and gradient-tracking mechanisms. This method can estimate locally the gradient of the empirical loss while enforcing agreement on the local estimates. They show it converges globally at a linear rate, achieving both optimal iteration complexity and communication complexity. While there is sufficient contribution, many of the core technical ideas build upon classical approaches to decentralized optimization.

The paper provides novel guarantees for the well-studied distributed sparse regression problem. Their theoretical results improve upon the state of the art and extend to settings that many previous results could not handle. From a technical perspective, their result builds upon previous frameworks, but also requires a number new, novel ideas. The paper does have some downsides; as mentioned previously, some of their ideas do build quite strongly off of previous work, and the presentation of the paper is quite dense, as several reviewers noted. However, the consensus of the reviewers overall is that the technical contribution of the paper is above the bar for acceptance, and would be of interest to the distributed optimization community.

This paper tackles the conformal prediction problem under adversarial perturbations. The proposed approach combines the non-conformity score with randomized smoothing and the standard conformal Prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed methods was demonstrated on the CifAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets. For safety-critical applications, it is important to build robust ways of quantifying uncertainty. This paper is well-written and reach the acceptance bar of ICLR.
Gold Metareview 30:
This paper studies the problem of producing distribution-free prediction sets using conformal prediction that are robust to test-time adversarial perturbations of the input data. The authors point out that these perturbations could be label and covariate dependent, and hence different from covariate-shift handled in Tibshirani et al 19, the label-shift handled in Podkopaev and Ramdas 21, and the f-divergence shifts of Cauchois et al 2021. 

The authors propose a relatively simple idea that has appeared in other literatures like optimization but appears to be new to the conformal literature: (i) use a smoothed (using Gaussian noise on X, and inverse Gaussian CDF) nonconformity score function, in order to control its Lipschitz constant, (ii) utilize a larger score cutoff than the standard 1-alpha quantile of calibration scores employed in conformal prediction. The observation that point (i) alone lends some robustness to adversarial perturbations of the data is interesting. As several experiments in the paper and responses to reviewers show, this comes at the (apparently necessary) price of larger prediction sets. 

I read through all the comments and also the supplement. The authors have responded very well to all the reviewers questions/concerns, adding significant sections to their supplement as a result. Three reviewers are convinced, but one remaining reviewer requested additional experiments to compare with Cauchois et al (in addition to all the others already produced by the authors originally and in response to reviewers). However, the authors point out that the code in the aforementioned paper was not public, but they were able to privately get the code from the authors during the rebuttal period. At this point, I recommend acceptance of the paper even without those additional experiments, since it is not the authors' fault that the original code was not public. Nevertheless, I suggest to the authors that, if possible, they could add some comparisons to the camera-ready since they now have the code.

I congratulate the authors on a nice work, a very solid rebuttal, and also the astute reviewers on pointing out various aspects that could be improved. 

Minor point for the authors (for the camera-ready): I would like to comment on the Rebuttal point 4.4 in the supplement, which then got further discussed in the thread. The reviewer points out four references [R1-R4]. I will add one more to the list [R5] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10634.pdf (Kivaranovic et al, appeared in 2019, published in 2020). I think the literature reviews in this area are starting to be messy, and all authors need to do a better job. Clearly, the original paper of Vovk et al already establishes various types of conditional validity (and calls it PAC-style guarantee), produces guarantees that others in this area produce, and it appears that much recreation of the wheel is occurring. For eg, [R2, R4] do not cite [R5], despite [R5] appearing earlier and being published earlier, and having PAC-style guarantees and experiments with neural nets, etc. However, in turn, [R5] do not cite Vovk [R1], but [R2, R4] do cite [R1]. (And [R3] does not seem to be relevant to this discussion of conditional validity?) In any case, I am not sure any of these papers need citing since the current paper does not deal with conditional validity. If at all, just one sentence like "Conditional validity guarantees, of the styles suggested by Vovk [2012], would be an interesting avenue for future work".

All reviewers agreed that analysis of PPO is interesting. 
During the discussion, however, there was an agreement that the current work is too thin in novelty and contribution: it provides only convergence analysis under very strong assumptions, and heavily builds on techniques from prior works. Meanwhile, for conventional policy gradient, recent works provided convergence rates.
As one reviewer pointed out - this work does not further our theoretical understanding on why PPO is better than vanilla policy gradient, as all the established results hold for policy gradient, even with less assumptions.
I encourage the authors to strengthen their paper by relaxing Assumption 4 (perhaps based on the robust classification idea raised in the discussion), and by further providing rate results.

This paper proposes a method for learning physics combining symbolic computation and learning in an interesting way, targeting sample efficiency. At the initial evaluation, it was on the fence but leaning towards acceptance, with 3 slightly positive and one slightly negative review. 

The strengths lie in the combination between symbolic reasoning and statistical ML with a formulation around the classical EM framework. On the other hand, an important issue of the paper is its quite simplistic evaluation on now very easy problems and benchmarks. While benchmarks tend to be simple in the field of learning physics, current work does address more difficult problems than the problems tackled in this paper.

Another issue discussed was the simple trade-off in injecting hand-crafted inductive bias into a system leading to increased sample efficiency, which was perceived as unsurprising by some reviewers. While this is common in ML, and even strongly more so in learning physics from data synthetically generated with known physical laws, it was perceived to be particularly unsurprising in this paper where the benchmarks are indeed very simple and the laws directly encoded.

The AC discussed this paper with the PCs, and it was judged that the weaknesses in evaluation, in particular the simplicity of the tasks, cannot compensate for the interesting hybrid symbolic/ML formulation, and decided to reject the paper.

The paper presents some interesting insights, but all reviewers have agreed that it does not meet the bar of ICLR. The theoretical results require revision as several issues have been indicated in the reviews. The authors have tried to correct them during the rebuttal, but the reviewers remain unconvinced.  Also the novelty is limited as re-ranking is a well-known concept and decoupling of head and tail labels is an approach often used in practice across many applications.

The authors should also clarify the way the RankNet method is used and implemented to clarify the issue raised by Reviewer 1. Finally, let me notice that adjusting thresholds for labels has been considered in the XMLC literature, in the context of optimization of the macro F-measure (Extreme F-measure Maximization using Sparse Probability Estimates, ICML 2016).

This is a strong paper, with novel technique which is clearly presented, and is backed by sound theory. The experimental results were also deemed extremely convincing by reviewers TJ4g and pZBb. 

Reviewer nqfu raised a question about the similarities between churn reduction and domain adaptation. The authors have addressed this by pointing out similarities to their work but also noting that, in the settings mentioned by the reviewer, alternative approaches such as completely retraining the model might be more appropriate. This part of the rebuttal is convincing.

Draft is a vector extension of [1] on studying how to approximately solve the global optima of a two-layered Relu network. The key of the analysis is to enumerate all possible sign patterns of the ReLU unit generating from specific data.

Unfortunately in the general case the complexity is exponential in the rank of the data matrix. The notation in some critical parts of the paper is not clear and makes reading difficult.

This paper proposes a framework based on principle components analysis (PCA) to speed up the missing data imputation. It divides the feature sets into two partitions -- the fully observed one and the one that contains missing values. The proposed method applies PCA to the fully observed partition to do dimensionality reduction, followed by the existing imputation methods. The authors further propose to apply PCA to the imputed data to speed up the downstream classification task.

The major weakness is that the methodological contribution is quite limited. Projecting data into lower dimensional spaces to speed up downstream tasks is not new. In particular, the main assumption of random missingness has been considered before 10-20 years ago and the more challenging setting of non-random missingness was not considered. Overall the reviewers mostly agree that the contribution is limited.

The paper describes a self-supervised learning method based on an information maximization criterion that naturally prevents dimensional collapse. The authors consider the Shannon mutual information under the assumption that the data is Gaussian. A first-order approximation to the log-determinant of the sum of two matrices is used to simplify the final objective. Experiments on 4 image datasets show that the proposed approach gives better results than contrastive and non-contrastive methods.

Strengths:

1 - The paper is well written and easy to follow.
2 - The paper is theoretically grounded on correlative information measure of representation.
3 - Strong results on some downstream classification problems.
4 - Initially the experiments included only one downstream task regarding classification, but the paper has been updated to include also results for object segmentation and detection task.
5 - Novel and well motivated.
6 - state-of-the-art SSL performance.

Weaknesses:

- Some weaknesses are pointed out by reviewer GZwK, but these are not well justified.

Decision:

A majority of reviewers vote for acceptance. The only reviewer voting slightly towards rejection is GZwK, with a reasoning that is not well justified. For example, the main criticisms mentioned by reviewer GZwK

- The paper directly generalizes the earlier proposed log-determinant mutual information to the field of self-supervised learning. 
- this paper does not give a deep-going analysis that why the second-order statistics can play a important role in self-supervised learning

This paper proposes environment fields, a representation that models reaching distances within a scene. Dense environment fields are learnt using a neural network, and the effectiveness of this representation is shown on 2D maze environments and 3D indoor environments. This paper received hugely contrasting reviews, with two reviewers being very supportive and one reviewer providing the lowest score of 1. In light of this, I'll start with providing my takeaways on the review and discussion with reviewer z3Y4 (rating of 1) and then proceed to the remaining discussion.

Reviewer z3Y4 has provided the score of 1 and has made strong remarks that include: "what is proposed in this paper is simply not comprehensible", "description of the method itself is simply devoid of all required detail", "The main claims of the paper are incorrect or not at all supported by theory or empirical results." and " what is being proposed in this paper is simply too unclear and vague to be assessed". **Such dismissive remarks, in my opinion, are completely unnecessary and create a toxic discussion and review environment.**

Reviewer z3Y4 has many criticisms of the submission, but the primary ones include: (a) the lack of details throughout the paper (b) the positioning of the paper in the abstract and introduction, and (c) the lack of experiments in continuous environments. Re (a): It is well understood in our research community that providing every last detail in the main submission is nearly impossible due to the restriction on the number of pages. Providing excess details in the main paper also often reduces the readability of the paper. Such details are better addressed in the appendix and crucially, the code. The authors have provided some details in the appendix and have indicated that they will release a code base.  I also agree with the authors that justifying every last detail in the network architecture such as choice of an activation function is not necessary for this submission. The same goes with describing methods in past works in detail vs referring the reader to the appropriate citation. As a result, I believe that the authors have addressed (a) well. Re (b): This has also been addressed by the authors, by pointing out relevant parts of the paper that had the necessary details. Re (c): In this regard, the paper clearly contains a well laid out experiment in 3D indoor scenes, so as far as I am concerned, this has been addressed in the main submission.

Reviewers AhgQ and fAEP have supported this submission but also laid out some concerns that include:
(1) Are the gradients suboptimal ?
(2) Positioning the paper with regards to past works
(3) Motivation behind using the VAE
(4) Qualitative analysis and failures
The authors have addressed these 4 concerns well using the rebuttal as well as via a revision of the appendix. The reviewers, post discussion have indicated their satisfaction with the revised submission.

I think this paper is interesting and proposes a novel scene representation which can be useful for others in the Embodied AI community. I am in agreement with reviewers AhgQ and fAEP, and in spite of the strong reject score by z3Y4, I recommend accepting this paper.

This paper builds upon the work of Boa et al (2017 ) (Conditional VAE GAN) to allow attribute manipulation in the synthesis process. In order to disentangle the identity information from the attributes the paper proposes adversarial information factorization. The motivation of adding this auxiliary network, which is to distinguish the information between latent code z and attribute vector y, is clean and clear. Experimental results also show the proposed model learning to factor attributes from identity on the face dataset.

The paper proposes a supervised adversarial method for disentangling the latent space of a VAE into two groups: latents z which are independent of the given attribute y, and \hat{y} which contains information about y. Since the encoder also predicts \hat{y} it can be used for classification and the paper shows competitive results on this task, apart from the attribute manipulation task. Reviewers had raised points about model complexity and connections to prior works which the authors have addressed and the paper is on the borderline based on the scores. 

Though none of the reviewers explicitly pointed out the similarity of the paper with Fader networks (Lample et al., 2017), the adversarial setup for getting attribute invariant 'z' is exactly same as in Fader networks, as also pointed out in an anonymous comment. The only difference is that encoder in the current paper also predicts the attribute itself (\hat{y}), which is not the case in Fader n/w, and hence the encoder can be used as a classifier as well (authors have also mentioned and discussed this difference in their response). However, the core idea of the paper as outlined in the title of the paper, ie, using adversarial loss for information factorization, is very similar to this earlier work, which diminishes the originality of the work. 

With the borderline review scores, the paper can go in either of the half-spaces (accept/reject) but I am hesitant to recommend an "accept" due to limited originality of the approach. However, if there is space in the program, the paper can be accepted.

Surreal-GAN aims to create fake pathological data with a latent variable and a healthy input. It includes an inverse function that predicts the latent variable from a fake/real pathological data. The results show that the model has a higher c-index than NMF, LDA and FA predictions. The method frames the diseased brains as multiple disease-related features at various severity imposed on normal brains. The paper is well clearly organized, and the general idea of the method is very interesting.

The authors present a GAN for learning a continuous representation of disease-related image patterns from regional volume information generated from structural MRI images.
The reviewers find the problem relevant and appreciate the proposed solution. They find the paper well-written and find the empirical results on Alzheimer brain MRIs relevant for the neuroscience community.
 
The overall objective function includes several hyper-parameters. As pointed out as the main weak point by multiple reviewers this may hint at overengineering/overfitting to a data set. However, the reviewers also mention that the regularizers are all sufficiently well-motivated in the paper and the author response.

Reviewers highlight comparisons on the real data as a strong result demonstrating that Surreal GAN was able to isolate two major sources/locations of atrophy in Alzheimer’s disease. Overall, the reviews are positive in majority.

This paper presents a large corpus of Korean legal documents, paired with labels corresponding to two classification tasks, two legal judgment prediction tasks, and one summarization task. Reviewers praised the uniqueness of the new resource.

However, there is some criticism of the results section, with several reviewers bringing up possible comparisons to other models and wondering whether the performance of this model has been analyzed thoroughly.  The authors argue in particular that mT5 and KoGPT-2 can benefit from continued pre-training this corpus, which seems satisfactory, although there is the question raised by 7fpy that this is essentially pre-training on the test tasks and may be too generous when assessing the performance on other legal-domain tasks that arise down the road.  Reviewer 7fpy brings up some valid critiques of the dataset construction: several points about filtering were unclear, as was the strength of the automatic pipeline used to construct the dataset.

There are a few ethical concerns raised by the ethics reviewer, which I believe are serious. Point [1] is resolved. Point [2] about misuse seems valid and harder to argue against.  The data does have value for use in the kind of more benign studies the authors report in the response there. But its very existence could encourage the construction of certain kinds of automated tools for legal judgment prediction, which has been a hotly-debated issue in the NLP community before. Ultimately I will defer to the ethics reviewer on this one, who seems satisfied.

Overall this paper seems like a well-done effort. The main question is whether its utility (modulated by issues with the results) outweighs the risks of putting it out there. Reviewers seem to lean positive on this and I would lean positive as well.

This paper introduces the first NAS benchmarks on graphs. Ratings were quite diverse, with scores of 4,5,6,7,7,8.
The many positive reviewers highlighted that GraphNAS is very relevant and that a benchmark for them would be very useful for the community. The benchmark includes comprehensive evaluations on as many as 9 different datasets, which may also help facilitate research on meta-learning for (Graph)NAS. Initially, the code for creating the benchmark and analysis was not available, which is a no-go for tabular NAS benchmarks, but the authors fixed this in the rebuttal period.
The most negative reviewer, 8asK, appears to not be familiar with tabular NAS benchmarks and their usefulness, and did not react to the discussion about it, as well as to the modification of the paper to highlight it. The other borderline negative review, by reviewer LkTe, had as their main ciriticism that NAS methods should be benchmarked on many spaces, but the point of tabular NAS benchmarks is *not* to provide a conclusive assessment of the performance of NAS methods that holds in general across search spaces (as a "horserace" paper might try to achieve), but rather to facilitate the cheap evaluation of current and future NAS methods on a single search space. For these reasons, I do agree more with the positive reviewers and recommend acceptance of this work as a poster.

Gold Metareview 46:
This paper proposes an architecture of a policy network (WaveCorr) that is particularly effective for portfolio management tasks.  A key observation that leads to the design of WaveCorr is that the dependency across asset should be treated differently from the dependency across time.  The proposed WaveCorr has the property that it is "permutation invariant" with respect to assets, which means that the class of functions that can be represented by WaveCorr is invariant to permutation of assets.  WaveCorr is shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in a portfolio management task.

A major point of discussion was the definition of "permutation invariance".  The reviewers and AC understood the difference between the permutation invariance defined in this paper and that studied in the prior work (the output of a network is insensitive to the permutation of the particular values of the input).  With the definition in this paper, however, a fully connected layer is permutation invariant, but the Corr layer proposed in the paper appears to have more structure.  It is unclear exactly what properties of the Corr layer leads to the performance improvement.

Reviewers agree that this paper presents a systematic study on the impact of hyper-parameters and training strategies of previous works. Based on those empirical observations, they propose a simplified model with layer reduction and single-stage distillation, which do not rely on a complicated and ad-hoc training strategy. Extensive experiments are conducted with thorough comparison with existing works. Authors also clearly point-out their current limitations.

The major concern is that this paper is more focused on discussion of the effectiveness of training strategies in previous methods, while the theoretical contribution is somehow limited. It would be much better if authors could explain their observations (more training epochs is needed while additional distillation stages can be discarded) from a theoretical perspective, although this may be far out of the scope of this work. Nonetheless, this paper presents valuable empirical study over existing Transformer compression methods and may inspire following research; therefore, AC recommends acceptance.

This paper proposes a methodology to create cheap NAS surrogate benchmarks for arbitrary search spaces. Certainly, the work is interesting and useful, with comprehensive studies to validate such approach. It should be credited as belonging to the first efforts of introducing and comprehensively studying the concept of surrogate NAS benchmarks. In AC's opinion, it is a solid paper that will (or has already) inspire many follow up works. The paper is well written. 

This paper received highly mixed ratings. Although the authors might not see, all reviewers actually participated in the private discussions. Reviewer 1eb8 indicated hesitation in her/his support. Reviewer yTPb stated that if not considering the arXiv complicacy, she/he "would certainly raise score by one level".  AC also reached out to Reviewer yTPb about her/his mentioned possibility of updating scores, and got confirmed that her/his original opinions wasn't changing after rebuttals. Besides, AC agrees the arXiv/NeurIPS complicacy shouldn't brought into the current discussion, and ignored that factor during decision making. 

The main sticking (and considered-as-valid) critique is on the relatively outdated and incomplete selection of baselines. As a benchmark paper, it should capture and diversify the recent methods. For example, the authors might consider adding: https://botorch.org/docs/papers (latest methods in Bayesian Optimization) https://github.com/facebookresearch/LaMCTS (latest methods in Monte Carlo Tree Search) https://facebookresearch.github.io/nevergrad/ (latest methods in Evolutionary algorithms)

Given the above concerns, AC considers this paper to sit on the borderline, and perhaps with pros outweighing the cons. Hence, a weak accept decision is recommended at this moment.

It is good to mention that the authors did a good job in replying to comments and criticisms, which has clarified a few misunderstandings. Personally I would recommend the authors not to use the confusing terminology between Bayesian and frequentist approaches that are employed in the paper, because it has generated more harm than benefit (at least among those in the discussion here).

This paper builds upon existing works to prove that learning (correlated) equilibrium can be fast, i.e., faster than \sqrt{n} even in extensive form games.

Three reviewers are rather lukewarm, and one reviewer is more positive (but seems less confident in his score). The two major criticisms is that this paper is very difficult to read and that the results might seem rather incremental with respect to the literature.

I tend to agree with both points but the paper still as merits: the reason is that extensive form games are intrinsically way harder than normal form games and they more or less all have a burden of notations. We agreed  that the authors actually did some efforts to make it fit within the page limit. but another a conference or a journal would have been better suited than ICLR.

Our final conclusion is that the result is interesting yet maybe not breathtaking for the ICLR community; we are fairly certain that another venue for this paper will be more appropriate and that it will be accepted in the near future (I can only suggest journals based on the large amount of content and notations, such as OR, MOR, or GEB - yet, conferences such as EC should be more scoped too) . It does not, unfortunately, reach the ICLR bar.

This approximation allows the proposed method to be essentially a factor of O(n) faster than its competitors. The paper is well-motivated and clearly-written. The proposed methods are simple-yet-effective, and the theoretical results are strong. Comparison with prior works looks comprehensive.

This paper provides two routines to replace gradient updates with low-rank unitary updates, and provides extensive technical discussion and experiments.  Reviewers are uniformly positive, and I also voice similar praises, e.g., I too appreciate the extensive discussion in appendices A and B, and the detailed experiments in the later appendices.  As such, it is easy to recommend acceptance, and I will push for this to receive at least a spotlight.  Even so, I urge the authors to make careful revisions for remaining issues raised by the reviewers, and to perform a full pass of their own.

The paper studies the problem of robust envy-free rent division. In the conventional problem variant, given n individuals and their evaluations for n rooms, the goal is to find a rule to allocate the rooms and fairly split the rent such that everyone is satisfied. This paper proposes three robust approaches for the envy- free rent division problem. The robustness and the computation times of the proposed approaches are demonstrated on user data collected from Spliddit.

The paper proposes a learning framework for compositional representations of goals for goal-conditioned RL. The goals reside in a low-dimensional representation space that is obtained from high-dimensional sensory data. The method is simple to implement in existing architectures and uses established approaches that have been developed for some time now. The paper is overall very well written, and the ideas and results are communicated clearly. It shows favorable performance over several baselines on multiple environments.

This paper proposes a discrete and compositional representation of goal states for goal-conditioned RL. The idea is to learn a goal representation via self-supervised learning and discretize the learned representation via VQ-VAE, and finally use the learned goal representation for goal-conditioned RL. The proposed method improves performance on several goal-conditioned RL benchmarks.

All of the reviewers found the idea simple and reasonable, and the results on a variety of benchmarks are quite comprehensive and strong. Although there were concerns around why the proposed discretized representation forms a semantically meaningful latent space and where the improvement comes from, the authors addressed them during the rebuttal period with updated results. All of the reviewers became in favor of the paper as a result. Thus, I recommend accepting this paper.

This work proposes a method for reducing memory requirements in RNN models via binary / ternary quantisation. The proposed RNN is tested on 6 sequence modelling tasks/datasets and shows drastic memory improvements compared to full-precision RNNs. Experiments are carried out on character-level and word-level language modeling, as well as sequential MNIST and question answering. The key contribution is applying batch normalization to both input matrix vector and hidden matrix vector products within recurrent layers.

Gold Metareview 65:
This submission proposes a method for learning sparse DNNs which consists of three components: First, a "dense" network is maintained and updated in each backwards pass, but the forward pass is done via a sparsified version of the network; sparsification is done via "soft" thresholding; and the sparsity ratio is increased over the course of training. Reviewers noted that each of these components had been previously proposed, and that the state-of-the-art baselines are not actually state-of-the-art anymore. They also noted that the paper read more like a draft and needs substantial improvement. The consensus was therefore to reject.

This work is well written and easy to follow and proposes a novel framework to utilize unlabeled output data. The authors have also given a detailed proof that the denoiser reduces the required complexity of the predictor. However, ultimately the experimental results are somewhat weak and leave doubts as to how effective the approach is. More convincing experimental results such as significant improvements on a well understood task and acknowledging that the approach is mostly useful when combined with pre-training and back translation would improve the work.

Pros
- Well written.
- Technically novel approach to the problem of utilizing unlabeled output data.
- Interesting proof on the reduced complexity requirement for the predictor.

Cons:
- Experimental results are not convincing. Showing significant improvements on a well understood task would be more convincing.
- The approach is only really useful when combined with pre-training or back-translation.

The authors present BASGD and asynchronous version of SGD that attempts to be robust against byzantine failures/attacks. 
The papers is overall well written and clearly presents the results. Some novelty is present as there have been limited work in asynchronous algorithms for byzantine ML. 

However, there have been several concerns raised by the reviewers, on which I agree, and they have not been fully addressed:
1) the tradeoff between asynchrony and robustness, as BASGD cannot handle the case of a buffer being straggler, which limits some of the novelty in this work
2) issues with the definition of privacy leakage has not been fully addressed
3) some reviewers mentioned the theoretical results being of limited importance, but arguably this is true for other related work in this area. Perhaps a general criticism is valid as to what is the operational value of the proposed guarantees. That is convergence does not exclude a model that has undesirable properties, eg has bad prediction accuracy for a small subset of tasks.
4) Finally, the motivation of the system model of the paper ( eg storing gradients as opposed to instances) paper is of unclear practical relevance, as was raised by multiple reviewers. 

Overall the consensus was that the paper does have merits, however, some of the most major concerns were not properly addressed. This paper can potentially be improved for a future venue.

This paper studies post-training quantization by proposing Network-Wise Quantization (NWQ) an end-to-end quantization approach that takes into account relationships between layers rather than treating layers independently. Using this approach, the paper demonstrates compelling empirical gains across a number of architectures and compression factors. Reviewers recognized the practical success of the approach as demonstrated by these empirical results and praised the clarity of the manuscript. However, there were concerns regarding the novelty of the approach and whether the proposed method is simply a composition of previous methods. While I understand these concerns, I think there is a significant delta between this work and previous approaches, especially when taking into account the markedly improved performance and the challenges of determining how to apply these lines of thinking to end-to-end training. The authors also expanded their discussion of these works in their updated manuscript, clarifying the differences. There were also concerns regarding the hyperparameter tuning, but the authors clarified in their response that the large majority of experiments used a constant set of hyperparameters, suggesting that these results are not simply the effect of tuning. Altogether, I think this paper makes an impactful contribution and will be a valuable addition to the conference.

Gold Metareview 70:
This paper does two things. First, it proposes an approach to estimating the mutual information between the input, X, or target label, Y, and an internal representation in a deep neural network, L, using MINE (for I(Y;L)) or a variation on MINE (for I(X;L)) and noise regularization (estimating I(X;L+ε), where ε is isotropic Gaussian white noise) to avoid the problem that I(X;L) is infinite for deterministic networks and continuous X. Second, it attempts to validate the information bottleneck theory of deep learning (Tishby and Zaslavsky, 2015) by exploring an approach to training DNNs that optimizes the information bottleneck Lagrangian, I(Y;L) − βI(X;L+ε), layerwise instead of using cross-entropy and backpropagation. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show improvements for the layerwise training over cross-entropy training. The penalty on I(X;L+ε) is described as being analogous to weight decay. The reviewers raised a number of concerns about the paper, the most serious of which is that the claim that the layerwise training results validate the information bottleneck theory of deep learning is too strong. In the AC's opinion, R1's critique that "[i]f the true mutual information is infinite and the noise regularized estimator is only meant for comparative purposes, why then are the results of the training trajectories interpreted so literally as estimates of the true mutual information?" is critical, and the authors' reply that "this quantity is in fact a more appropriate measure for “compactness” or “complexity” than the mutual information itself" undermines their claim that they are validating the information bottleneck theory of deep nets because the information bottleneck theory claims to be using mutual information. The AC also suggests that if the authors wish to continue this work and submit it to another venue, they (1) discuss the fact that MINE estimates only a lower bound that may be quite loose in practice and (2) say in their experimental section whether or not the variance of the regularizing noise was tuned as a hyperparameter, and if so, how results varied with different amounts of noise. Finally, the AC regrets that only one reviewer participated in the discussion (in a very minimal way), despite the reviewers' receiving several reminders that the discussion is a defining feature of the ICLR review process.

The paper presents a "conceptual  advance connecting causality, disentangled representation learning, invariant representations and robust classification". Authors propose to decompose the image generation process to independent mechanism that can be composed (foreground masks (shapes), forground texture, and backgrounds), allowing for a specific image to generate counterfactuals , by changing some variations factors, while keeping other fixed. One can use interventional data to augment classifiers, this can lead in certain cases to improvement in accuracy and in other in improving the robustness. 

There was concerns about the clarity of the paper regarding the structured causal model considered and its applicability beyond image generation, experimental protocol for choosing hyperparameters (loss scaling and ratios of real data and interventional samples ) and some missing references. The rebuttal of the authors and their updated paper reflected comprehensively all those concerns and addressed them, highlighting limitations of the method and adding more examples of its failures. 

I liked the ideas and concepts in  this paper , and it will be exciting to generalize such generative approach to other domains, this  work is a first step. I think it will be good addition to ICLR program

The paper proposes new techniques for improving the generalization ability of deep learning models for Knowledge Tracing (KT). Instead of designing more sophisticated models, the paper investigates simple data augmentation techniques that can be applied to train existing models. In particular, three different augmentation strategies are proposed based on replacement, insertion, and deletion in the training data. These strategies are then applied with appropriate regularization loss ensuring consistency and monotonicity in the training process. Extensive experiments are performed using three popular neural models for KT and four publicly available datasets. Overall, the paper studies an interesting problem in an important application domain of online education. The results are promising and open up several exciting follow-up research directions to explore more complex data augmentation techniques for KT.

I want to thank the authors for actively engaging with the reviewers during the discussion phase and sharing their concerns about the quality of the reviews.  The reviewers generally appreciated the paper's ideas; however, there was quite a bit of spread in the reviewers' assessment of the paper (scores: 4, 5, 6, 7). In summary, this is a borderline paper, and unfortunately, the final decision is a rejection. The reviewers have provided detailed and constructive feedback for improving the paper. In particular, the authors should incorporate the reviewers' feedback to better position the work w.r.t. the existing literature on data augmentation and state of the art results, better motivate the data augmentation strategies in the context of educational applications possibly through additional data analysis, and add more ablation studies w.r.t. the hyperparameters associated with data augmentation. This is exciting and potentially impactful work, and we encourage the authors to incorporate the reviewers' feedback when preparing future revisions of the paper.

The AC has taken into account all strengths and weaknesses mentioned by reviewers in making a recommendation for this paper. Here is the summary of what was considered in carefully considering a final decision:

* Reviewers agree that the presented resource, the Dollar Street dataset, addresses a need for models that can be held more accountable in terms of geographic diversity and demographic diversity. 
* There is generally no issues in terms of methodology or soundness of the proposed resource.
* Unfortunately, experiments on demonstrating the usefulness of this resource are limited, and largely replicate what was already found in Devries et al. 2019, a workshop paper at CVPR from three years ago which also used the same source of data -- and at the same scale. The analysis in this previous paper in some way go further by matching image categories using human evaluators individually for each image -- as pointed out by reviewer dcyB.
* The dataset was downloaded from a third party's website and as such the authors had no control in how the images were collected, nor there was any effort to enhance this resource in terms of annotations, diversity or size.
* The dataset size is 38k images which is a rather small dataset for training or enhancing a model, and its use would be limited mostly as a benchmark dataset. As a benchmark however experiments seem limited as pointed by reviewer eAoC. An experiment on training on this dataset and evaluating on this dataset is performed only with a Resnet network, however it is hard to assess what is the significance of this experiment. 

There are various suggestions made by reviewers below that would enhance the quality of this paper. Despite shortcomings, reviewers are still enthusiastic to see this dataset in an easy to use format as a benchmark. I also strongly suggest the authors to revise their section on licensing where it says "Training machine learning models on public domain work is widely accepted legally." as it does not seem appropriate for this paper to be making determinations or recommendations as to what is considered legal or not.

The authors were responsive to reviewers’ comments and have respectively improved their paper by adding experiments, including an ablation study of each component of the objective function, study of the effect regularization on unbalanced class distributions, reporting accuracy on pseudo-labels.  While two reviewers have slightly increased their scores, some concerns still remain.

This is a borderline paper, and after some discussion and calibration, we decided that the work in its current form does not quite meet the bar for acceptance.

This work claims to propose a general methodology for approximating offline algorithms in online settings. The motivation of bridging the gap between offline algorithms and their online counterparts is clear and practical. The main methodology is to predict an offline algorithm’s actions in the real time future via learning behavioral structures of the offline algorithm. Results on one-dimensional synthetic and stock-market data show that the predictive behavior of this method matches our intuitions. It is most accurate when explaining the data and least accurate when predicting into the future.

## A Brief Summary
This paper uses offline algorithms that can see the entire time-series to approximate the online algorithms that can only view the past time-series. The way this is done is basically, the offline algorithm is used to provide discrete class targets to train the online algorithm. The paper presents results on synthetic and historical stock market data.

## Key Takeaways and Thoughts
Overall, I think the problem setup is very interesting. However, as pointed out by reviewers gii5 and EgW5, due to the lack of baselines, it is tough to compare the proposed algorithm against other approaches, and this paper's evaluation is challenging. I would recommend the authors include more ablations in the future version of the paper and baselines and address the other issues pointed out above by the reviewers.

The paper introduces Ask4Help, a method for augmenting an existing policy with the ability to fall back to an expert policy during an episode. This is achieved without retraining the existing pre-trained agent by introducing a meta-controller that will select whether to follow the agent or the expert at every timestep. The proposed method is evaluated on two tasks, namely object navigation and room rearrangement. The experiments on RoboTHOR show that the proposed method can achieve higher success rates using fewer expert queries.

I thank the authors for their submission and active participation in the discussions. This paper introduces a method for learning a policy that can ask an expert for help, i.e., to obtain the expert action. On the positive side, reviewers found the method to be general [uya8], original and significant [gw2r], intruiging in terms of being able to reuse an existing policy [HGan], and tackling an important problem [rsmr,bRWC], and the paper to be clear [uya8,gw2r,rsmr,bRWC]. In terms of negative points, reviewers were concerned about the novelty [bRWC], unimpressive qualitative results despite strong quantitative results [bRWC], and issues with the range of baselines [bRWC,rsmr] and ablations considered [uya8]. Overall, the paper is borderline. However, bRWC indicated they would raise their score but I don't see this being reflected. Furthermore, in my view reviewer rsmr's concerns regarding baselines and ablations has been addressed by the author rebuttal. Thus, I am siding with reviewers gw2r and HGan, and recommend acceptance. However, I very strongly encourage the authors to further improve their paper based on the reviewer feedback, in particular the points raised by reviewer bRWC regarding the importance of the Success Prediction component of the method.

The paper proses a new adversarial (poisoning) defense based on a known graph reweighting scheme known as the ricci curvature. It is not clear to the reader if the sampling scheme/training scheme is the major reason for adversarial robustness. The paper lacks clarity at some points and has inconsistencies in notation. The only novel part is that each layer gets a new graph; however, this choice is not motivated (why not to train all layers of GNN on different graphs instead?)
Gold Metareview 85:
The paper proposes a new defense against adversarial attacks on graphs using a reweighting scheme based on Ricci-flow. Reviewers highlighted that the paper introduces interesting ideas and that the use of Ricci-curvature/flow is a novel and promising contribution. Reviewers also recognized that the paper has significantly improved after rebuttal and clarified some aspects of their initial reviews.

However, there exist still concerns around the current version of the manuscript. In particular, important aspects of the method and algorithm, as well as some design choices are currently unclear. This includes evaluating and discussing robustness, training method, and practicality/improvements in real-world scenarios. I agree with the majority of the reviewers that the current version requires an additional revision to iron out the aforementioned issues. However, I also agree with the reviewers that the overall idea is promising and I'd encourage the authors to revise and resubmit their work with considering the feedback from this round of reviews.

It presents a critical analysis of the measures used to assess the quality of policies learned via HRI driven reward learning.

Post discussion update
------------------------

The authors completed a rebuttal that addressed all of the reviewers' critiques, and also uploaded a revised and improved manuscript. The most significant improvement seems to be the addition of a small related work section in the introduction and a limitation plus future work section at the end of the paper. However, since the final paper has an 8 page limit, the current 9-page manuscript will need to be shortened. 

The clarifications seemed to sway two of the reviewers toward increasing their ratings. Generally, it's clear that although this is a non-standard paper, it raises interesting and potentially provocative points that would be great for the CORL community to discuss. Therefore, I am recommending acceptance.



Original review
----------------


This paper addresses the HRI challenge of measuring how well a robot has learned a user's reward function. It describes two main types of measures---parameter-based and reward-based---and provides both theoretical and empirical examples of the shortcomings of each. 


Strengths
* This seems like the type of paper that would be useful to assign in an HRI course or give to a new grad student, because it clearly explains the different measures and provides a comparison of them.

* Reviewers noted that the issues brought up by this paper are important and very relevant to current approaches. The paper is timely.

* Reviewers agreed that paper balances well between theory and empirical examples. 

* The paper was well written and easy to understand.


Weaknesses

* The main critique is that reviewers feel that the paper doesn't go deeply enough into the discussion of what to do with these findings. How should robotics researchers use this information to design better measures? In what cases are these measures likely to fail, or to be accurate? Section 6 poses such questions, but it would add substantially to the novelty of the paper if there was some suggestion of where to go from here.  

* Although the paper bills itself as a survey, reviewers noted that it doesn't provide much of a discussion of related work. Reviewers also provided additional citations that address some of the issues brought up regarding current measures of performance. 

* A couple of reviewers questioned the connection to robot learning in particular.

* There is no limitations statement, which is a required component.

A special motion token which encodes the past trajectory is introduced to further boost the tracking performance. SwinTrack is evaluated on major SOT benchmarks and achieves SOTA performance. The idea to use SwinTransformer instead of a CNN in the branches seems to be novel. The experiments show state-of-the-art results on large-scale tracking datasets.

Authors present a method for single object tracking (SOT) that is entirely comprised of transformers. The architecture is simple: 

1) Swin is used to generate embeddings for both template and search region
2) Embeddings are concatenated
3) An encoder transformer performs MHSA of the embeddings.
4) A decoder performs cross-attention from search tokens to template tokens and a special "motion token" which is constructed from a linear operation over the prior motion trajectory relative to the frame. 
5) Output token is fed to final layers that perform IoU aware classification and bounding box regression.

Evaluations are performed on 5 SOT datasets, achieving SOTA on all of them.


Pros:
- [AC/R] Important problem, technically sound, and new SOTA on this task.
- [AC/R] New motion token approach is novel and provides significant improvement.
- [AC/R] Simple and elegant architecture
- [AC/R] Insightful discussions
- [AC/R] Clearly written and easy to follow
- [AC/R] Interesting ablations

Cons:
- [R] Low novelty of transformer approach, but this is negated by the novelty of the motion token.
- [R] Details regarding pretraining are missing. Authors provide in response.
- [R] Motivation of motion token design is not clear. Authors provided further ablations of different implementations of the motion token, showing the current form performs best.
- [R] Provide additional details regarding where and how SwinTrack outperforms other approaches on the benchmarks. Authors provided additional granularity of performance stratifications within the LaSOT benchmark.
- [R] Add more recent high performing trackers. Authors added several methods published in 2022.

This paper presents a probing analysis on clean (non-robust) vs. adversarially trained robust models. It only employs PGD asdversarial training for obtaining a "robust" model. Robust representations are less specialized and distant layers are more similar in robust networks. Early layers converge faster and later layers overfit to local minima. The paper is well-written and experiments clearly described. It is based on the perspective of representation similarity. Such a perspective provides an interesting direction to delve deeper into the properties of robust representation learning.

The authors study representations obtained from image classifiers and contrast the classic training with adversarial training, so-called non-robust and robust networks, respectively. The authors primarily use the CKA metric on CIFAR10 and subsets of ImageNet2012 provide several novel insights on "salient pitfalls" in robust networks which suggest that robust representations are less specialized with a weaker block structure, early layers in robust networks are largely unaffected by adversarial examples as the representations seem similar for benign vs. perturbed inputs, deeper layers overfit during robust learning, and that models trained to be robust to different threat models have similar representations.

The reviewers agreed that these contributions are interesting to the larger community and that the presentation of the results is clear and straightforward. The main issues raised by the reviewers were carefully addressed in the rebuttal. Please update the manuscript as discussed.

The paper proposes a new curriculum for RL method. The basic idea is to "learn" a residual for each task, modeling in this way how the tasks differ. The method is tested on four different problems and is compared with two 3 baseline methods. The manuscript contributes interesting ideas and the proposed method seems to have good performance. The idea of using the sum of residuals to model the state-action function approximation was interesting. The algorithm learns on Bellman residuals between the current task and that of the previous task.

The paper proposes a novel curriculum learning method for RL based on the concept of boosting. The proposed method builds on the curriculum value-based RL framework and uses boosting to reuse action-values from previous tasks when solving the current task. The method is analyzed theoretically in terms of approximation accuracy and convergence. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The reviewers acknowledged the importance of the studied problem setting and generally appreciated the results. I want to thank the authors for their detailed responses that helped in answering some of the reviewers' questions and increased their overall assessment of the paper. At the end of the discussion phase, there was a clear consensus that the paper should be accepted. The reviewers have provided detailed feedback in their reviews, and we strongly encourage the authors to incorporate this feedback when preparing a revised version of the paper.

While there are some doubtful statements, overall the paper is well written and easy to read. The authors failed to discuss their paper with "ON THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF DECODERBASED GENERATIVE MODELS", which uses AIS to estimate the likelihood. The assumption made by the authors that "generator is injective" is problematic or even wrong.

The paper's strength is in that it shows the log likelihood objective is lower bounded by a GAN objective plus an entropy term. The theory is novel (but it seems to relate closely to the work https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02771.) The main drawback the reviewer raised includes a) it's not clear how tight the lower bound is; b) the theory only applies to a particular subcase of GANs --- it seems that the only reasonable instance that allows efficient generator is the case where Y = G(x)+\xi where \xi is Gaussian noise. The authors addressed the issue a) with some new experiments with linear generators and quadratic loss, but it lacks experiments with deep models which seems to be necessary since this is a critical issue. Based on this, the AC decided to recommend reject and would encourage the authors to add more experiments on the tightness of the lower bound with bigger models and submit to other top venues.

The paper builds on the following two observations: KGs are incomplete often lacking facts that would be needed for reasoning to answer a question. Current methods over-retrieves facts (edges) from the KG leading to a lot of unrelated facts that potentially makes reasoning noisier and harder. The proposed model then sparsifies the graph by learning edge weights via a two-step message passing process. The experiments, however, only show modest (yet still positive) empirical gains.

The paper proposes an interesting step in the direction of neuro-symbolic reasoning. While there is no consensus among reviewers about the key novelty of the method, all acknowledge the interest of the direction. All of them also recognize that the submission improved greatly during the discussion phase: clarification of motivations, of experimental settings and results, of discussion with previous work.

However, despite those improvements, the submission is not yet ready for publication at ICLR. We encourage the authors to use the very detailed reviews and comments to improve the work. In particular, we encourage them to pay attention at three aspects:

1/ Comparison with large language models: the discussion wrt T5 is important. A key motivation for the proposed model is that it is bringing information and elements for QA (or other reasoning tasks) that purely scaling up language models can not bring. Or maybe they can bring the same kind of improvement but at a much lower computational cost. In any case, this is a very important point to justify the interest of such approach, and neuro-symbolic reasoning overall, empirically.

2/ Using GPT2 (or equivalent): the discussion on using GPT-2 for generating new facts is key too. It is essential to bring this description from appendix to the core of the paper. But more discussion are expected.  For instance, what if GPT-2 generates facts that are false and lead to answering and justifying a wrong answer? In other words, how does it impact the integrity of the contextualized KG? This is an essential point that needs to be worked on more thoroughly. 

3/ Overall there have been a lot of discussion to improve the motivations and the contributions. But they are not reflected in the paper necessarily. Following R2, we encourage the authors to "refocus the existing version (e.g., from vague discussion about neural-symbolic models towards establishing solid comparison to the most related previous work in various sections of the submission)"

This paper introduces a new distributed value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. It divides the system into two parts, multiple containers, and one centralizer. Containers are trained with trajectories generated by their own actors interacting with the environment. In contrast, the centralizer is trained with high-priority samples sent by all containers. By grouping actors, replay buffers, learners, and a queue manager into containers CMARL can be used to scale learning to the requirements of the multi- agent setting.

This paper proposes a distributed containerized multi-agent reinforcement learning(CMARL) framework that addresses three challenges in MARL: 1) Demanding data transfer. 2) Inter-process communication. 3) Effective Exploration. Using a container that collects environment experiences from parallel actors into buffers and learns local policies, CMARL demonstrates notable performance improvements with respect to time as compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Although the reviewers acknowledge that the paper addresses a relevant topic, proposes an effective method, and is well written, after reading the authors' feedback and discussing their concerns, the reviewers reached a consensus about rejecting this paper in its current form. They feel that the contribution is too incremental and that the experimental comparisons are somehow unfair.

I suggest the authors take into consideration the reviewers' suggestions while preparing an updated version of their paper for one of the forthcoming machine learning conferences.

The paper's initial evaluation was below par, but the author feedback helped clarify several crucial points after which two of the reviewers increased their scores by a point, bringing the current evaluation to borderline. 

The paper addresses a relevant and challenging problem in the RL domain. However, in my opinion, from the reviewers' and authors' remarks and from my own reading of the paper, there are concerns that need to be addressed before the paper can be publication worthy. Primary among these is the quantum of novelty -- as many reviews point out, the key idea of viewing an episodic trajectory as a multivariate (vector) sample for running hypothesis tests is not novel in itself, as is the claim that new tests have been devised. Another crucial issue is the (parametric) assumption of normality for the episodic reward sequence which is not adequately justified in the paper -- even a two time-step trajectory with normal rewards per state transition can exhibit a mixture-of-Gaussians type reward distribution for the second state, breaking the assumption. As it transpired from the reviews of Reviewer4, reducing environment shift/degradation to just a mean change problem, without even considering a change in the variances (2nd order statistics), seems to be too stylized to be effective. There are other, nonparametric approaches in statistics based on testing for changes in the distribution function (kernel density estimation approaches, for instance), which could perhaps be applied without normality assumptions and yield favourable results. The experimental results for detection delay often show significant overlaps of the delay distributions for different procedures (e.g., Hotelling vs. Mean vs. UDT etc.), which does not indicate an advantage of the proposed method. 

I would urge the author(s) to assimilate the feedback and delve deeper as to why and how parametric procedures based on normality assumptions may or may not succeed, so as to significantly strengthen the theoretical and practical message of this work.

Theoretical analysis is provided to calibrate gradients of both features and CAG blocks in the backward process. The number of clusters $k$ is tied to the bit, then the performance degradation of extreme cases including 1-bit or 2-bit. The novelty of capturing such channel-dimension structured information is good. The existing communication-optimized methods either are insufficient in reducing the traffic or may degrade the model performance. This work proposed a hierarchical compression algorithm for feature data, called Stripe-wise Group Quantization.

The paper proposes a method to generate attention masks to interpret the performance of RL agents. Results are presented on a few ATARI games. Reviewers unanimously vote for rejecting the papers. R1, R3 give a score of 5, whereas R4, R5 give a score of 4. Their concerns are best explained in their own words: 

R1 says, "The use of attention maps to analyze and explain deep neural networks is not new in itself, and learning attention maps to improve vision tasks is not new either."

R3 says, "the analysis of the learned attention masks seems selective. Some automatic metrics or systematic studies of different game categories (shooting, maze-like, and ball-and-paddle) may shed light on the learned attention's general property."

R5 says, "I am still not convinced by the quality of the provided visual explanations nor am I convinced that the attention is well correlated with the current frame (the additional experiments provided do help somewhat in this regard, but are not extensive and reasonably inconclusive"

In their rebuttal, to address R1's concern authors suggested that the use of attention on both value and policy networks is novel. This is not sufficient, because it does not show why such attention maps are more useful than ones proposed by prior work. As suggested by reviewers, a systematic study or a human study clearly showing that the proposed method adds more interpretability is critical. However, this is missing.  In response to R3, the authors provided experiments on more games. But this is not the point -- because it's not about the number of environments in which experiments are provided, but rather the nature of the analysis that is performed. Finally, R5 comments that it's unclear whether attention actually provided interpretability or not. 

Due to the lack of convincing analysis that demonstrates the utility of the proposed method in advancing the understanding of decisions made by RL agents, I recommend that the paper be rejected.

The idea to deal with label noise by transforming noisy class labels into noisy similarity labels seems to be novel. In most cases the proposed Class2Simi can improve the accuracy compared with baselines. But the improvement is not significant in many cases like those on MNIST and CIFAR10. The proposed method has been evaluated on multiple datasets with consistent improvement across all noise ratios. The paper empirically demonstrates that the proposed method works well on several synthetic datasets and a large-scale real-world dataset.
The idea to deal with label noise by transforming noisy class labels into noisy similarity labels seems to be novel. In most cases the proposed Class2Simi can improve the accuracy compared with baselines. But the improvement is not significant in many cases like those on MNIST and CIFAR10. The proposed method has been evaluated on multiple datasets with consistent improvement across all noise ratios. The paper empirically demonstrates that the proposed method works well on several synthetic datasets and a large-scale real-world dataset.

The paper's stated contributions are:

(1) a new perspective on learning with label noise, which reduces the problem to a similarity learning (Ie, pairwise classification) task

(2) a technique leveraging the above to learn from noisy similarity labels, and a theoretical analysis of the same

(3) empirical demonstration that the proposed technique surpasses baselines on real-world benchmarks

Reviewers agreed that (1) is an interesting new perspective that is worthy of study. In the initial set of reviews, there were concerns about (2) and (3); for example, there were questions on whether the theoretical analysis studies the "right" quantity (pointwise vs pairwise loss), and a number of questions on the experimental setup and results (Eg, the computational complexity of the technique). Following a lengthy discussion, the authors clarified some of these points, and updated the paper accordingly.

At the conclusion of the discussion, three reviewers continued to express concerns on the following points:

- *Theoretical justification*. Following Theorem 3, the authors assert that their results "theoretically justifies why the proposed method works well". The analysis indeed provides some interesting properties of the reduction, such as the fact that it preserves learnability (Appendix F), and that the "total noise" is reduced (Theorem 2). However, a complete theoretical justification would involve guaranteeing that the quantity of interest (Ie, the clean pointwise classification risk) is guaranteed to be small under the proposed technique. Such a guarantee is lacking. 
  - This is not to suggest that such a guarantee is easy -- as the authors note, this might involve a bound that relates pointwise and pairwise classification in multi-class settings, and such bounds have only recently been shown for binary problems -- or necessary for their method being practical useful (per discussion following Theorem 3). Nonetheless, without such a bound, there are limits to what the current theory justifies about the technique's performance in terms of the final metric of interest.

- *Comparison to SOTA*. Reviewers noted that the gains of the proposed technique are often modest, with the exception of CIFAR-100 with high noise. Further, the best performing results are significantly worse than those reported in two recent works, namely, Iterative-CV and DivideMix. The authors responded to the former in the discussion, and suggested that they might be able to combine results with the latter. While plausible, given that the latter sees significant gains (Eg, >40% on CIFAR-100), concrete demonstration of this point is advisable: it is not immediately apparent to what extent the gains of the proposed technique seen on "simple" methods (Eg, Forward) would translate more "complex" ones (Eg, DivideMix).
  - In the response, the authors also mentioned that (at least the initial batch of) the experiments are intended to be a proof-of-concept. This would be perfectly acceptable for a work with a strong theoretical justification. However, per above, this point is not definitive.

- *Creation of Clothing1M*. The authors construct a variant of Clothing1M which merges the classes 3 and 5. Given that prior work compares methods on the original data, and that this potentially reflects noise one may encounter in some settings, it is advisable to at least report results on the original, unmodified version.

- *Issues with clarity*. There are some grammatical issues (Eg, "is exact the"), typos (Eg, "over 3 trails"), notational inconsistencies (Eg, use of C for # of classes in Sec 2, but then c in Sec 3.1), and imprecision in explanation (Eg, Sec 3.2 could be clearer what precise relationships are used from [Hsu et al. 2019]).
  - These are minor but ought to be fixed with a careful proof-read.

Cumulatively, these points suggest that the work would be served by further revision and review. The authors are encouraged to incorporate the reviewers' detailed comments.

This paper is the first to achieve the optimal convergence rate under the NTK regime. They show that smooth target functions are learned rapidly at faster convergence rate. The paper is technically sound and the proof techniques are different from existing literatures. This result is not a *plug and play* based on the current kernelized-SGD litterature. The quality of the paper is undeniable and fills the gap between optimality of NTK literature. Overall, I vote for accepting.

This paper presents a novel neural network architecture to predict interacting residues among two interacting proteins, and evaluates its performance on benchmarks. While the reviews were initially mixed, there has been a productive discussion and significant improvements in the paper during the discussion, including in particular much needed clarifications about the proposed methods, and more experimental results with an ablation study to better assess the benefits of various design choices. While no reviewer is willing to champion this paper as a "strong accept", due to the relatively modest novelty compared to existing methods, there is a consensus towards "weak accept" given the final quality of the work presented and potential usefulness of the method for the problem tackled.

Authors empirically evaluate the method over a set of visual Mujoco tasks and Atari games. The method is novel and the results are strong. However, it would benefit from a more detailed study in order to understand where the reported gains come from. The algorithm iterates between minimizing a contrastive loss and maximizing an intrinsic reward.

The authors propose a particle-based entropy estimate for intrinsic motivation for pre-training an RL agent to then perform in an environment with rewards. As the reviewers discussed, and also mentioned in their reviews, this paper bears stark similarity to work of 5 months ago, presented at the ICML 2020 Lifelong ML workshop, namely, "A Policy Gradient Method for Task-Agnostic Exploration", Mutti et al, 2020--MEPOL. What is novel here is the adaptation of this entropy estimate to form an intrinsic reward via a contrastive representation and the subsequent demonstration on standardized RL environments.  The authors have added a comparison to MEPOL, and in these experiments, APT outperforms this method, sometimes by some margin. Unfortunately this work does not meet the bar for acceptance relative to other submissions.

The authors propose an efficient method to perform message passing on a truncated Gaussian kernel CRF. The experiments seem to show performance in par with the FullCRF on decoupled training. The main points of this paper are the use of the convolution operator to perform the message passing mean field inference. Using this operation allows us to get away from the permutohedral lattice and yet allows speed up of 100x. The paper is well written with many relevant references and easy to read.

The authors replace the large filtering step in the permutohedral lattice with a spatially varying convolutional kernel. They show that inference is more efficient and training is easier.

In practice, the synthetic experiments seem to show a greater improvement than appears in real data.  There are concerns about the clarity, lack of theoretical proofs, and at times overstated claims that do not have sufficient support.

The ratings before the rebuttal and discussion were 7-4-6.  After, R1 adjusted their score from 6 to 4.  R2 initially gave a 7 but later said "I think the authors missed an opportunity here. I rated it as an accept, because I saw what it could have been after a good revision. The core idea is good, but fully agree with R1 and R3 that the paper needs work (which the authors were not willing to do). I checked the latest revision (as of Monday morning). None of R3's writing/claims issues are fixed, neither were my additional experimental requests, not even R1's typos." There is therefore a consensus among reviewers for reject.

This paper provides theoretical analysis for two kinds of straight-through estimation (STE) for activation bianrized neural networks. It is theoretically shown that the ReLU STE has better convergence properties than the identity STE. The discussions for most theoretical results are very short or not organized well. The paper demonstrates that training with the latter against the population loss is guaranteed to converge to a critical point. This paper is the first to use Ste to train convolutional networks with binary activations and non overlapping patches.

Valid criticisms of the presentation quality were raised during the review and response period, and the authors would be well served by continuing to improve the paper's clarity.

The authors propose a role diversity metric to quantify the difference between agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning. They also find that the error bound in MARL can be decomposed into three parts that have a strong relation to the role diversity. To evaluate the proposed method, they conduct some experiments on MPE and SMAC environments. The metric is used to inform the use of communication, parameter sharing, and other MARL algorithmic decisions. The discovered guidelines about the choice of training strategies will benefit the community. The theoretical analysis is not well-motivated.

This paper proposes a Role Diversity metric, meant to quantify how different roles are in a multi-agent RL setting. There's actually three versions of this metric, or three aspects (the distinction is not entirely clear to this area chair).

The reviewers are generally not very enthusiastic about the paper, with scores hovering at or just below the acceptance threshold. There has been extensive discussion between reviewers and authors, but there a sense that there is confusion about the exact purpose and contribution of the paper. This is reinforced by the authors' "letter to area chair", which outlines several ways the reviewers have not gotten the message. Reading the paper, it appears to me that the root cause is that the authors are indeed not communicating clearly what the paper contributes and why. It is, after all, the authors' responsibility that the reviewers understand the work. My own impression is that the text is dense and not particularly easy to get through. Perhaps the authors are simply trying to cram too many contributions into a single conference paper? This is a classic error which leads to hard-to-read papers. In addition to this, there is a lingering concern about the generalizability of the proposed methods.

I think the authors need to work more on their presentation, and perhaps reconsider which parts to include in their paper and exactly which measure they want to send, before they submit to another venue.

Extensive experiments show that with the proposed method, a naive compression method can achieve the SOTA on several continual learning benchmarks. This paper studies the problems of classification and object detection from natural image datasets in a continual learning setting. The strategy used by the paper is to fill this memory buffer with compressed data samples.

This works considers limitations of rehearsal-based methods in the context of continual learning (classification and object detection). Rehearsal-based methods provide a strong baseline, but a loss in predictive performance arises when the memory is limited in size. The authors propose to leverage compression (JPEG) to increase the number of data (images) stored in the memory. The approach is evaluated in the context of an autonomous driving application.

The additional experiments conducted by the authors were highly appreciated and helped clarify open questions (e.g., class-incremental learning set-up, DPP objective to determine size of the memory, quantity vs quality of compressed data, etc.). The authors addressed the issues raised by three out of four reviewers, who did not have further comments. The remaining reviewer found that the methodological contributions of this paper, namely of using compression in the context of CL, was pretty straightforward. However, the authors addressed the concerns raised by the reviewer regarding the selection of the compression quality q as far as I am concerned and conducted additional experiments to further demonstrate the usefulness of the approach. I would encourage the authors to include this discussion in the final version of the paper. I would also encourage them to include the additional experiments they conducted with fixed memory size and amount of memory that can be saved.

Initially, the paper had mixed reviews (455).  The major concerns from the reviews were:

1. missing refs about unprojection. (K314)
2. quality advantage is not convincing, slightly better than FSM, while qualitative results show not obvious improvements. (K314)
3. visualize the depth maps as point clouds (K314)
4. what is the trade-off between resolution/memory, computation, and depth estimation? (K314, ZBww)
5. insufficient experiments (9Ef1)
6. comparison with monocular methods (9Ef1)
7. cubic vs spherical space? (9Ef1)
8. can it be trained on real data w/o GT supervision? (9Ef1)
9. how to handle collision of multiple pixel rays? (ZBww)
10. why use different MLPs to fuse "overlap" and "non-overlap" features? No ablation study on this. (ZBww)

The authors wrote a response to address these concerns, providing more qualitative results and ablation studies, as well as further explanations.  The reviewers were satisfied with the response, and K314 upgraded their rating to 6, while other reviewers maintained 5s. The reviewers appreciated the novel problem and the solution that can produce more consistent depth maps across views, and also synthesize depth maps in novel views. After reading the paper, the AC agrees with the reviewers, noting that the paper  addresses the limitations of the problem setup of previous work [13], thus developing a new line of research.  Thus, the AC recommends accept. The authors should prepare a revised version of the paper according to the reviews, rebuttal, and discussion.

This paper describes how to use normalizing flows for selecting features in a way that controls the type-1 error by using a normalizing flow along with MCMC to sample from the null distribution. The majority of the reviewers were positive, however the most confident reviewer was negative. From taking a look at that reviewers concerns, I tend to agree with most of them.

The paper is titled knockoff-free, which means in the context of this paper that both 1) 1-bit p-values are not used and 2) The full knockoff property is not required, only sampling from complete conditionals are required. Most of the experiments compare knockoff methods to the proposed approach, so it's not clear if 1) 1-bit p-values are not great or 2) the model-X process/complete conditional sampling process is better with normalizing flows. The former point is known and the latter point on the best way to sample from the complete conditionals is really the value. 

If we take the paper as, 

1) complete conditionals are 1-D
2) MCMC can be used to sample from a 1-D unnormalized density
3) Simple MCMC won't be bad because the problem is 1-D

-> Any likelihood based deep generative model can be used to sample complete conditionals

then it's a solid paper.

On the other hand, the belief that flows are the correct choice versus other likelihood-based deep generative models is harder to take as there's only a comparison with a mixture density network used in the original HRT paper. Also from other uses of these models, different models are better in different situations. I'd suggest a heavy discussion in the paper on this point at the minimum. Maybe even a reframing of the paper is needed.

Finally, for the test statistic, the HRT may not be the best choice for work like this paper that studies the problems with estimating X-distribution. The  paper "CONTRA: Contrarian statistics for controlled variable selection" at AISTATS 2021 shows that the HRT test statistic is more sensitive to model-X estimation errors than a simple mixture statistic that doesn't give up much power. The choice of test statistic also merits some discussion in step 3.

This paper proposes TopicGAN, a generative adversarial approach to topic modeling and text generation. TopicGAN operates in two steps: it first generates latent topics and produces bag-of-words corresponding to those latent topics. In the second step, the model generates text conditioning on those topic words.

Pros: 
It combines the strength of topic models (interpretable topics that are learned unsupervised) with GAN for text generation.

Cons: 
There are three major concerns raised by reviewers: (1) clarity, (2) relatively thin experimental results, and (3) novelty. Of these, the first two were the main concerns. In particular, R1 and R2 raised concerns about insufficient component-wise evaluation (e.g., text classification from topic models) and insufficient GAN-based baselines. Also, the topic model part of TopicGAN seems somewhat underdeveloped in that the model assumes a single topic per document, which is a relatively strong simplifying assumption compared to most other topic models (R1, R3). The technical novelty is not extremely strong in that the proposed model combines existing components together. But this alone would have not been a deal breaker if the empirical results were rigorous and strong.

Verdict:
Reject. Many technical details require clarification and experiments lack sufficient comparisons against prior art.

The focus of this paper is to analyze an end to end network to reconstruct matrices originating from non-Euclidean data which are corrupted. The authors present an untrained network for this task. In the review period the reviewers raised a variety of concerns including concerns about novelty of the paper with respect to existing work, technical depth and clarity. The authors did not respond to these concerns. Therefore, I recommend rejection.

The contributed data is data recorded from a pre-existing robotic object-stacking simulator. annotations are tracks of points on the surfaces of objects across four datasets. The quality of crowdsourced annotations is measured by crowdsourcing annotations of this synthetic data and comparing point tracks.

The paper introduces a transformer-based method for non-stationary time series forecasting. 
This research addresses a clear need, as acknowledged by the reviewers. Also, most reviewers found the method clearly described and the experiments compelling, demonstrating an improvement of the state of the art.

The reviewers asked questions about the baselines, evaluation methods and ablation studies. They also made requests related to clarifying the wording and some of the theory. The authors put in significant effort in addressing the comments, offering detailed responses to every reviewer. Only one of the reviewers responded during the discussion period, and the response came very late in the discussion period. However, I read the authors' response and concluded that they adequately addressed most issues raised by the reviewers.

As the model is in the Transformer space, and transformers have previously been shown to be state of the art on a number of tasks, I do not find it necessary to compare against other 'families' of methods. So I will consider that issue addressed as well.

In this paper, the problem of learning the optimal threshold policy for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is considered. Using the monotonicity property of threshold policies, an off-policy actor-critic algorithm is proposed to learn the optimal policy. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform other algorithms in the literature. The main contribution is based on the use of threshold policy and simplification of the policy gradient.

The paper considers a subset of dynamic problems, in which the optimal policy is a threshold-policy. The authors use this attribute to formulate tailored off-policy actor-critic algorithms, for both MDPs and RMABs which are gradient-based, so can utilize neural networks. They empirically compare their method to SOTA methods in three MDP domains and three RMAB parameterizations, the results show that their method, DeepTOP, performs better than the compared methods in all the experiments.

The paper is well written and the claims are correct.  The performance of DeepTOP compared to the other methods is impressive.  All four reviewers were on the positive side for acceptance.

Description of paper content:

The authors propose a dynamics model that can generalize to novel environments. The train and test MDPs have the same state and action spaces but different dynamics. Environment specific inference is achieved by estimating latent vectors Z that describe the non-stationary or variable part of the dynamics. These Z-s are inferred from trajectory segments in unlabeled environments. The Z-s are learned contrastively: Z-s from the same trajectory are pulled together, and Z-s from separate trajectories are pushed apart. However, to mitigate the error of distancing Z-s from different trajectories but the same environment, Z-s on trajectories with similar transitions are also pushed together using a soft clustering penalty. These losses are justified based on ideas from Pearl’s causal inference.

In an attempt to understand generalization, this paper aims at understanding the dynamics of functions presented by the network for different images in the training set. Authors look at activation patterns (whether a ReLU activation is on or off) as a way of characterizing the active paths in the network and approximating the function presented by the network for each image. Authors study different related statics (eg. correlation) and how they evolve during training including.

Pros: 
- Understanding the dynamics of training, how diversity is encouraged by the training procedure and its relationship to generalization is an important problem.
- This paper takes an empirical approach and tries to make interesting empirical observations about the dynamics of the training.

Cons:
- The paper is poorly written in terms of structure, making clear arguments with enough evidence, notation, etc.
- Some empirical trends are shown but their connections to the main claim of the paper about generalization is very weak. The main attempt to connect the observations to generalization is Fig. 7 which shows model accuracy correlated with the ratio of early to mid overlap. This is problematic both because it only has 6 data points and also because a simple correlation analysis is not enough to establish this claim which is more about the cause of generalization.

Reviewers have pointed to various concerns including but not limited to clarity of the paper, lack of rigorous arguments, not providing enough evidence for the arguments, etc. Unfortunately, authors did not participate in the discussion period.

Given the above concerns, I recommend rejecting the paper.

Gold Metareview 127:
I'm quite concerned by the conversation with Anonymous, entitled "Why is the dependence...". My issues concern the empirical Rademacher complexity (ERC) and in particular the choice of the loss class for which the ERC is being computed. This  class is obviously data dependent, but the Reviewers concerns centers on the nature of its data dependence. It is not valid to define the classes by the Jacobian's norm on the input data, as this _structure_ over the space of classes is data dependent, which is not kosher. The reviewer was gently pushing the authors towards a very strong assumption... i'm guessing that the jacobian norm over all data sets was bounded by a particular constant. This seems like a whopping assumption. The fact that I can so easily read this concern off of the reviewer's comments and the authors seem to not be able to understand what the reviewer is getting at, concerns me.

Besides this concern, it seems that this paper has undergone a rather significant revision. I'm not convinced the new version has been properly reviewed. For a theory paper, I'm concerned about letting work through that's not properly vetted, and I'm really not certain this has been. I suggest the authors consider sending it to COLT.

This paper provides a novel and non-trivial method for approximating the eigenvectors of the Laplacian, in large or continuous state environments. Eigenvectors of the Laplacian have been used for proto-value functions and eigenoptions, but it has remained an open problem to extend their use to the non-tabular case. This paper makes an important advance towards this goal, and will be of interest to many that would like to learn state representations based on the geometric information given by the Laplacian. 

The paper could be made stronger by including a short discussion on why the limitations of this approach. Its an important new direction, but there must still be open questions (e.g., issues with the approach used to approximate the orthogonality constraint). It will be beneficial to readers to understand these issues.

Interesting approach aiming to leverage cross domain schemas and generic semantic parsing (based on meaning representation language, MRL) for language understanding. Experiments have been performed on the recently released SNIPS corpus and comparisons have been made with multiple recent multi-task learning approaches. Unfortunately, the proposed approach falls short in comparison to the slot gated attention work by Goo et al.

The motivation and description of the cross domain schemas can be improved in the paper, and for replication of experiments it would be useful to include how the annotations are extended for this purpose.

Experimental results could be extended to the other available corpora mentioned in the paper (ATIS and GEO).

The paper proposes an approach for learning a decomposition of a scene into 3D objects using single images without pose annotations as training data. The model is based on Slot Attention and NeRF. Results are demonstrated on CLEVR and its variants. 

The reviewers point out that the method is reasonable and the paper is quite good, but even after considering the authors' feedback agree that the paper is not ready for acceptance. In particular, the key concern is around experimental evaluation - that it is performed on one dataset (and variants thereof) and that the evaluation of the 3D properties of the model is not sufficiently convincing: it does not outperform 2D object learning methods on segmentation and is not compared to those on "snitch localization".

Overall, this is a reasonable paper, and the results are promising but somewhat inconclusive, so I recommend rejection at this point, but encourage the authors to improve the paper and resubmit to a different venue.

(One remark. The paper makes a point of not using any annotation. It is technically true, but in practice on CLEVR unsupervised segmentation works so well that it's basically as if segmentation masks were provided. If the authors could demonstrate that their method - possibly with provided coarse segmentation masks - works on more complex datasets, it would be a nice additional experiment)

This paper provides an interesting generalized perspective on SSL techniques and proposes a debiasing technique that can be viewed as decreasing the variance of the risk estimate. The authors argue that this leads to estimators that are better than the purely supervised estimator under a rather weak assumption called MCAR - which assumes that the probability of a missing label is independent of covariate and label. 

Although the exposition and perspective are interesting, this paper is borderline for the following two main reasons:

1. A few reviewers were not convinced of the theoretical result that is supposed to show that unlabeled data strictly helps - indeed, whereas usual variance reduction techniques (e.g for optimization schemes such as SGD etc.) lead to a strict gain in terms of convergence rate, there is no clear asymptotic/high probability statement that indicates statistical gain of the corresponding estimator (which is what we really care about - not the risk estimate). The dependence of lambda_opt on theta (which changes every iteration) does not help in providing such a statement. Since this is the primary contribution of the paper, I would suggest the authors follow through with the analysis to show a gain for the actual estimator compared to the "complete case" (only using supervised data). 

On that note, the authors claimed in their rebuttal that they have added an asymptotic variance analysis in Appendix I, which indeed would have made a very valuable point - however, I could only find a copy-pasted version of Theorem 3.1. in Appendix I? Similarly, Appendix F does not seem to include the comparison between debasing using labeled and unlabeled data but instead contains the proof of Theorem 3.2. Perhaps the wrong revision was uploaded, but unfortunately, given the current version, this point is not adequately addressed.

2. If the experimental results were more extensive and conclusive, then the current theorem could have perhaps been alright as a mainly methodological contribution. However, as the authors note, extensive experiments require a lot of compute power - however, given the lack of the ultimate theorem, the methodology becomes the primary contribution and would thus require more experimental evidence as the reviewers asked for.
  
Addressing one of the above points would push the paper above the acceptance threshold which we hope the authors can pursue in their next submission.

Meta Review: The paper presents a new means to learn sparse Choquet integral, using for instance classical L_1 penalization techniques. This research participates to a long trend of research aiming at learning preference functions in various settings (here, having only limited preferential information). 

All reviewers agree that the paper is well-written and the contribution nicely presented. Two main critics were done by the reviewers:

* The first is the potential significance of the research, i.e., that it addresses an actual real-world problem. After discussion and rebuttals, this critic appears to be of less importance

* The second (with which I would concur) is that the experimental part is limited in different ways. The main critics regarding those are as follows:
1. The authors only use synthetic data that mostly comply with their assumptions, thereby confirming that their approach is valid. THey do not really challenge it.
2. There is no realistic data sets used (which is very difficult to obtain in incremental preference learning, but less in passive preference learning).
3. There is also no real comparisons with other methods intending to learn value functions from observed preferences. Given the large literature on preference learning and the fact that most learning papers require the comparisons with other baselines when possible, one could have hoped to have such comparisons.

The proposed SCL-WC method outperforms state-of-the-art weakly-supervised whole-slide image classification studies. The application of contrastive learning, i.e., MoCov3, in histopathological image classification is very common. The proposed method consists of two main steps: a domain-specific self-super supervised feature extractor and task-specific feature aggregation modules. Ablation studies are conducted to help understand the importance of each proposed component.

This work presents a method to obtain slide level representations in computational pathology. The specific contributions of this work are a positive-negative-aware module (PNM) and a weakly-supervised cross-slide contrastive learning (WSCL) module and a loss to encourage intra-WSI local patch separation and inter-WSI global feature contrast. The idea is to use the attention weights in a MIL framework as patch level pseudo labels. These are used to compute "weights" for positive and negative patches (the latter of which is assumed to be significantly larger in number for a given WSI). By using these weights in a contrastive manner to push the representations from positive patches away from those of negative patches, the model learns more effectively since it is less susceptible to the noise from the negative patches.

The reviewers found these contributions novel. During the review, the largest source of concern was along the choices made during the empirical evaluation. Specifically, the manuscript in its current form lacked empirical backing for several of the choices made regarding the neural architecture, the algorithm for self-supervised learning etc. In response to this the authors conducted several different kinds of ablation studies (which were incorporated into the supplement) during the rebuttal process, which other reviewers found convincing as a potential explanation of the outcomes.

Overall, I found the main contributions of this work (leveraging patch level attention weights as psuedo labels) to be an interesting use case for computational pathology to better focus the learning signal on positive patches. My additional comment is that I think the additional ablation experiments (and references) are an important part of the contributions of this work and should be incorporated into the main paper rather than in the appendix (several equations can be compressed to make space in the manuscript in addition to the additional page).

This submission presents a detailed numerical study of gradient flow of feedforward neural networks. Different layers of the three-layer architecture exhibit changes to their parameters. To the best of my knowledge, this submission gives new insight into training dynamics of MLPs with more than one hidden layer. Despite a few typos the paper is well presented and easy to read. The most important part of the paper, where the parameters gamma2 and gamma3 are derived, is rushed.

This work studies the effect of initialization scaling on the gradient flow training dynamics of three layer (two hidden layer) MLPs. . Extending Luo et al. 2021's analysis, the authors identify "linear", "critical" and "condensed" regime depending on initialization scaling parameters

Strength pointed out by the authors include, "new insight into training dynamics of MLPS with more than one hidden layer", "elegant and insightful analysis" for a "dauntingly difficult problem" and that "phase diagram is neat and valuable contribution"

Reviewer `PDY9` saw major weakness as treating the second layer as linear regime only, which makes the analysis similar to previous work (Luo et al., 2021). In general, the reviewer believes that the full comprehensive analysis on different phases for each layer is lacking. Although the reviewer did not respond to the AC, this issue has been addressed by author response. Also please do follow the recommendation of the reviewers in terms of improving writing (better description of gamma_2, gamma_3 for example), improving related works, as well as making figures more legible. 

Overall, while the paper is somewhat borderline, there are interesting insights and analysis as the reviewers pointed out without critical issues. I recommend accepting this work at NeurIPS 2022.

This paper presents a genetic algorithm framework for molecular optimization. It produces valid molecules through the crossover and mutation operations along with appropriate fitness functions. The main claim of the paper (benefit of two-stage procedure) is not supported by empirical results. The experiments in the paper are limited and not very relevant to real-world drug discovery. It would be more interesting to explore a variety of more complex tasks. The reward is a combination of several objectives like Eqn.

The paper describes a genetic algorithm for molecular optimization under constraints. The aim is to generate molecules with better properties while close to an initial lead molecule. The proposed approach is a two-stage one. The first stage aims to satisfy constraints and searches for feasible molecules that are similar to the lead. The second stage optimizes the molecular property. The method is evaluated on logP optimization task, with minor improvement over previous work.

The reviewers point out the following strengths and weaknesses:

Strengths:

- Molecular optimization under structural constraints is an important research direction.
- Comprehensive related work section.

Weaknesses:

- Lack of novelty because it is a standard application of genetic algorithm.
- The results show that the proposed method did not outperform existing baselines.
- The main claim of the paper (benefit of two-stage procedure) is not supported by ablation study.
- The authors only conduct experiments on improving LogP, which is a benchmark that is too easy and not challenging.
- The objective function and cross-over operation are the same or very similar to previous work.
- The experimental evaluation is limited, and the overall setting is not very relevant to real-world tasks.

Overall, all reviewers vote for rejection. It is clear that the paper needs more work before it can be published.

The storage cost may not be a concern as one can generate random permutation on the fly without storing them.

The authors consider a novel problem of characterizing the tail behavior of the random regret for algorithms that are designed to solve the multi-armed bandit problem. They show that the distribution of regret has a heavy tail in the large T regime for the standard policies. It shows that it is possible to achieve light-tailed and worst-case optimal regret at the same time.

The paper proposes a framework for characterizing harmful text generated from LLMs. This is a timely and extremely important topic, and the paper engages with the complex socio-technical questions around it. The reviewers are split in their opinions (three in favor of acceptance; three opposed). The key argument raised against the paper is that it does not introduce a new benchmark or dataset, and does not make falsifiable claims. The meta-reviewers consider the paper to be well in-scope for the track: despite lacking empirical results, it provides a "framework for responsible dataset development" and clearly identifies "significant problems with existing datasets."  The authors successfully address the other concerns. The paper makes an important contribution to the community and deserves to be accepted.

Gold Metareview 152:
The authors propose training-free neural architecture search using two theoretically inspired heuristics: the condition number of the Neural Tangent Kernel (to measure "trainability" of the architecture), and the number of linear regions in the input space (to measure "expressivity"). These two heuristics are negatively and positively correlated with test accuracy, respectively, allowing for fast, training-free Neural Architecture Search. It is certainly not the first training-free NAS proposal, but achieves competitive results with much more expensive NAS methods.

A few reviewers mentioned limited novelty of the method, a claim with which I agree. The contribution of the paper, however, is something different than how it was presented. The core message seems to be that the two proposed heuristics can greatly speed up NAS, and should be a baseline method against which more expensive methods should test.

I feel like this is a borderline paper, but may be of interest to researchers in the field.

During the discussion among reviewers, we have shared the concern that this work has a significant overlap with [Liu et al. 2018] and [Liu & Motani 2020]. Although the authors tried to address this concern by the author response, I also think that the difference is not enough. In particular, the reviewers pointed out that Figure 1, Table 1, and Figure 3 are exactly the same with those in [Liu, 2020], and Proposition 2 in [Liu & Motani 2020] is Proposition 1 in this paper. Since these overlaps are not acceptable, I will reject the paper.

The authors show that larger-sized language models memorize training data faster. This memorization happens before the overfitting of language modeling. Specific part-of-speech-tagged tokens are memorized faster like nouns and numbers. Larger models also tends to forget less, and they seem to memorize unique parts of speech tokens. The authors have not discussed the limitations of their work thoroughly. The paper measures memorization as the proportion of correctly predicted labels (which corresponds to predicting the correct next/masked token) and forgetting as the decline in memorization.

The authors demonstrate that complete neural network verification methods that use limited precision arithmetic can fail to detect the possibility of attacks that exploit numerical roundoff errors. They develop techniques to insert a backdoor into networks enabling such exploitation, that remains undetected by neural network verifiers and a simple defence against this particular backdoor insertion. 

The paper demonstrates an important and often ignored shortcoming of neural network verification methods, getting around which remains a significant challenge. Particularly in adversarial situations, this is a significant risk and needs to be studied carefully in further work.

All reviewers were in agreement on acceptance and concerns raised were adequately addressed in the rebuttal phase, hence I recommend acceptance. However, a few clarifications raised by the official reviewers and public comments should be addressed in the final revision:
1) Acknowledging that incomplete verification methods that rely on sound overapproximation do not suffer from this shortcoming.
2) Concerns around reproducibility of MIPVerify related experiments brought up in public comments.

Experiments are carried out on Sprites and MUG to demonstrate the efficacy. The authors propose a method called Halo that allows to disentangle the content from the motion in image sequences, in the VAE framework. They do so by separating the latent space in two spaces: 1) the content space, a global content vector that summarizes the image sequence, and 2) the motion space.

This paper proposes a novel type of variational auto encoder, referred to as HELO. The latent space is decomposed into a content space and a motion space, and the main contribution is the proposal to model the motion space using Hamiltonian dynamics. All reviewers agree that the idea of using Hamiltonian dynamics is interesting and novel. One main critique, that the authors agreed on, was that the operator does not contain any stochasticity and that this might be a limitation when applying the idea to model more complex data. Another remark was that the experiments are limited and experiments on less constraint data are missing. A quick look at the baseline methods revealed that they also use the same kind of data sets to evaluate their methods, so this latter concern might be of minor importance. 
All in all, the potential positive outcomes of this paper outweight its current limitations, so we recommend acceptance at this point, while urging authors to address the remaining concerns in the final version.

This paper introduces SUNMASK for modeling discrete sequences. It builds upon previous works such as SUNDAE, Coconet and order-agnostic NADE, but uses a masking scheme that enables fine-grained or human-in-the-loop control during the generation. The qualitative experiments about musical inpainting and masking terms in language modeling do support this motivation to some extent. However, the reviewers are mainly concerned with both the algorithmic novelty and experiments of the paper.
 
Regarding the algorithmic novelty, some reviewers are concerned that the method is a straightforward combination of SUNMASK and Coconet. I tend to agree with this. Also the reviewers are concerned that the paper could have done a better job in the introduction and background section by putting the method in a better context and better describing related methods such as SUNDAE. This could help highlight the novelty of the paper.
 
Regarding the experiments, some reviewers are concerned about language modeling (Fig. 2) experiments, and that they do not show much improvement over SUNDAE. I tend to agree, and this is also shown in the results of Table 3 where it is clear that the quality of the language model is not on a par with the recent developments.
 
Also some of the motivations of the paper, especially the arguments about "high trust / low trust" interpretation of the mask, was unclear to me.
 
In short, I believe the paper should be clarified and improved by addressing the above concerns.

This paper proposed a long-term object-based memory system for robots.  The proposed method builds on existing ideas of data association filters and neural-net attention mechanisms to learn transition and observation models of objects from labelled trajectories.  The proposed method was compared with baseline algorithms in a set of experiments.

The initial reviews raised multiple concerns about the paper. Reviewers nrGQ and  V7qP commented on the conceptual gap between the problem proposed in the introduction and the extent of the experiments. Reviewer qPet understood the paper to be a form of object re-identification and was concerned about the limited comparisons with related work.  The author response clarified their goal of estimating the states of the objects in the world, which they state is different from the goals of long-term tracking and object reidentification mentioned by the reviewers.  The authors also clarified the relationship to other work in slot-attention and data association filters.  

The ensuing discussion among the reviewers indicated that the paper's contribution remained unclear even after the author response. Two reviewers noted the paper did not clearly communicate the problem being solved (all reviewers had a different view of the problem in the paper).  These reviewers wanted a better motivation for the problem being addressed in this paper.  The third reviewer remained unconvinced that the problem in the paper was different from long-term object tracking.

The proposed method outperforms six benchmarks with a large margin. The major concern of the proposed method is the label model. It is suggested that the authors should provide the graphs. The paper is somewhat presented in atelegraphic style. It's not clear how much the details add given that you don't give a big empirical exploration of the tradeoffs you derive. "Suppose that data $x, y, \lambda$ follows the model in (1)." is a big assumption.

Meta Review: This paper proposes LIGER to better use the foundation model in a weakly-supervised setting. LIEGER has two key components: 1) a finer estimator of weak source quality by dividing the embedding space and learning the source accuracy for each part, 2) source voting expansion  in the embedding space.

The reviewers agree that the proposed work is innovative and makes a significant technical contribution in using pretrained models under weak supervision. There were some concerns raised by reviewers, but most of them have been well addressed by the authors.  I recommend acceptance of this paper given its novelty and significant technical contribution.

The paper tackles a typically disregarded problem in contrastive learning. It shows the importance of selecting difficult negatives to obtain stronger unsupervised representations. The Ring model results in a simple method that can be applied to any contrastive algorithm resulting in a better representation. The paper chooses the negative samples in the range of $[w_l, w_u]$ percentiles. This sampling strategy improves the contrastivelearning methods (IR, CMC, MoCO)

Gold Metareview 161:
This paper addresses the problem of how best to sample hard negatives during contrastive learning, a topic of importance for the recently resurgent field of metric learning / contrastive loss-based unsupervised representation learning. Backed by theoretical results for a new low-variance version of the NCE, the paper proposes an easy-to-implement "Ring" method for selecting negatives that are at just the right level of difficulty, neither too hard nor too easy.

Happily, this is a paper that has improved significantly through the interactive peer review of a dedicated set of reviewers combined with prompt responses from the authors. Perhaps the result that tipped this paper over the line in my assessment: the new experimental results now show significant gains from applying the "Ring" approach for hard negative sampling to near-state-of-the-art implementations of the MoCo-v2 approach, which is among the leading unsupervised visual feature learning approaches. 

Generated Summary 162:
 ODConv combines two prior ideas, i.e. filter recalibration with attention in SENet and additive kernels in CondConv/DyConv. The method is overall quite efficient without too much overhead, due to separate attention weights for different dimensions. The proposed method can be plugged into most existing CNN architectures and has good performance on public datasets, such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. But the weakness of this paper is too experimental-oriented without thorough analysis on the results.

This paper presents ODConv, a convolution pattern which uses attention in the convolutions across all dimensions of the weight tensor.
The paper is well motivated and well explained, easy to follow.
This work is built on top of previous work, but reviewers all agree that the contributions of this paper are significant.
The experimental section is comprehensive, with several benchmarks, and show clear improvements.
The reviewers suggested a few additional remarks, and discussions to add to the paper, which the authors have addressed in the rebuttal. Reviewers seem in general happy with the authors answers to their concerns.
This seems like a sound and meaningful paper. I am fully in favour of acceptance, and I recommend this paper to be presented as a spotlight.

The authors propose an evolutionary ensemble method for decoding neural signals. The method involves initially training an ensemble model via minimizing a squared error loss on training data. The overall model prediction is then made from a weighted combination of ensemble members. The main advantage of the method is that the model can be adaptive to the variation of neural signals through evolution in the Bayesian framework. Unfortunately the extremely confused description makes it impossible to understand, much less reproduce the method.

The review ratings/confidences were 5/2, 6/2, 4/4, and 5/2. Although the average rating of 5 was just above the acceptance threshold, I think that it should somehow be discounted by the lower confidence levels. Although I myself does not have expertise in the field of BCI, as for the reviewers' evaluation, I think that they basically agreed on the following points:
- The problem is well motivated.
- The proposed method was built on DyEnsemble with some empirically-motivated extensions to have decoder models dynamically evolving. One could then argue that the proposal is not groundbreaking but somehow incremental.
- The authors showed experimentally that the proposed method works well compared with a number of other existing methods.

I also noticed that the authors made revision (adding a paragraph at the end of Section 2: It can be observed in the August 10 revision), which would have improved readability of this paper. I would thus recommend acceptance of this paper, provided that there is room for it.

The idea is to come up with a weight update rule which guarantees the convergence rate.

This paper aims to study the convergence of deep neural networks training via a control theoretic analysis. This is a very interesting approach to establish theoretical understanding of deep learning. However, there are several concerns raised by the reviewers:

1.	The contribution of this paper is limited. The results simply follow from standard optimal control. It is not clear what new insight the paper provides.
2.	There are already quite a few works on control theoretic analysis of deep learning. This paper did not do a good job on presenting its novelty and difference with existing works.
3.	The experimental part is weak. It only involves small data set and very simple networks.

Based on these, I am not able to recommend acceptance for the current manuscript. But the authors are encouraged to continue this research.

This paper studies the problem of choosing the best cloud provider for a task. The problem is formulated as a bandit and solved using algorithm CloudBandit. The algorithm is compared to several baselines, such as SMAC, and performs well. The evaluation is done on 60 different multi-cloud configuration tasks across 3 public cloud providers, which the authors want to share with the public.

This paper has four borderline reject reviews. All reviewers agree that it studies an important problem and that the promised multi-cloud optimization dataset could spark more research in the area of cloud optimization. The weaknesses of the paper are that it is not technically strong and that the quality of the new dataset is not clear from its description. At the end, the scores of this paper are not good enough for acceptance. Therefore, it is rejected.

This paper introduces a new dataset for evaluating disentanglement and its impact on out of distribution generalization based on the trifinger robotics platform. Using this dataset, the authors rigorously investigate the performance of beta-VAEs in this setting under a number of conditions, finding that weak supervision is necessary to induce disentangled representations, and that, perhaps surprisingly, disentanglement does not help for sim2real settings despite the similarity between the simulator and the real data. Reviewers were divided on the work, but had a number of concerns related to the claims of novel architecture, comparisons to baselines, and issues with the clarity of the paper, some of which were addressed in the authors' response. I agree with some of these concerns, particularly with respect to the claims of novel architectures since the modifications could simply be viewed as tweaking hyperparameters and are not rigorously compared to baselines. However, I think the novelty of the dataset and the rigorous evaluation of OOD generalization settings is likely to be valuable enough to the community to merit acceptance. I'd encourage the authors, however, to tone down some of the claims regarding the architecture (or provide sufficient baseline comparisons), and instead focus on the dataset and the OOD results. I recommend acceptance.

Overall, all reviewers see the novelty in the dataset that provides an original new set of tactile data, accounting for a wide range of objects and scene, collected in the wild. The paper is overall well written, clear and easy to follow, and provides a good demonstration of the importance and usefulness of the dataset, going beyond datasets collected by robots in the context of material properties. It also includes initial steps towards benchmarking, although it is not the core contribution of the paper, which lies in the creation of the dataset itself. 

Two reviewers recommend acceptance, two stand marginally below acceptance, and one does recommend rejection. The authors have provided detailed responses to all reviewers’ comments and concerns and updated their manuscript. The main concerns of those reviewers sitting on the fence seem to be answered and limitations acknowledged however the element of bias in the data collection was still considered as a possible concern. Based on my reading and accounting for the authors changes, there approach itself is novel and original and hence provides already a relevant contribution to NeuroIPS; while the authors acknowledge limitations and future work avenues. The one reviewer recommending rejection didn’t engage in the discussion but from my reading of both the paper, the comments, and the authors responses, I believe the main points were addressed by the authors and misunderstandings clarified. Overall, I believe the papers offers a novel, non-existing dataset that can inspire interesting future works; all the dataset is shared and presented clearly for others to use.

This paper proposes a new way to model discrete state diffusion models. The method is based on a 'continuous time' model. It uses a technique called 'tau-leaping' to test the model. While there is still a (relatively small) performance gap between this work and continuous diffusion models, I think it is an important work. I'd like to further raise my score if my concerns are addressed. The paper proposes to sample from the CT diffusion model via tau-Leaping, a well-known technique in chemical physics.

The work proposes a continuous-time generalization of diffusion models on a discrete space. The description uses continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), in parallel to the existing stochastic differential equation description for continuous space. Reverse CTMC and modeling and ELBO objective are described. Some practical considerations and inspirations are also discussed, including avoiding exponentially large model in high dimensions, efficient reverse (generation) process simulation, and a corrector technique that further exploit the model to improve simulation (generation) quality. An error bound on the learned data distribution is also presented that shows a mild dependency on data dimensionality.

All the reviewers agree that this work presents the very right way to describe the continuous-time version of diffusion model on discrete space, and thereafter inspired techniques make a desired contribution to the community. Some concerns are raised, including still inferior performance than the continuous counterpart, and on the independence among dimensions. The authors provide reasonable remarks on them. Hence, I recommend accept to this paper.

One minor point: In Sec. 4.2, it would be clearer if the independence is specified both among the random variables $x^{1:D}$ in “output” and between each $x^d$ in “output” and $x^{1:D\backslash d}$ in “input”. Conventionally independence refers to the former, in which case the size is only reduced to $S^D \times D S^2$.

The major concerns about this paper are that (1) There are too many hyper-parameters, such as those needed for ADMM. I'd point out that there are adaptive variants of ADMM and heuristics methods for choosing optimization hyper-parameters, although it would be nice if the authors addressed these issues in the paper.  (2) Some reviewers are concerned that, compared to other related attacks, it’s unclear why flipping fewer bits is an important objective - an attacker might only care about poisoning performance and clean data performance.  The authors respond that flipping fewer bits makes the attack more effective when bits are manipulated by a physical method such as manipulating memory.  Despite these criticisms, reviewers agree that the paper is a well thought-out approach that improves the state of the art by some metrics.

The goal of this paper is to evaluate methods for detecting out-of-distribution samples in a more comprehensive fashion than prior work. Using a pre-trained network improves OOD detection (in line with previous results), but one particular method does. The results show that cosine similarity consistently outperforms other methods across all sub-tasks. There is no real discussion or insights into why certain methods work in some scenarios and not others. Fine-tuning/pre-training gives a strong performance boost for OoD detection.

This paper proposes an OOD evaluation framework under three categories: irrelevant input detection, novel class detection, and domain shift detection. As with several reviewers, the AC recognizes the importance and effort to distinguish between different cases of OOD detection, as well as the amount of experimental comparison across several prominent methods in literature (MSP, MC-dropout, cosine similarity, ODIN, Mahalanobis).  

Despite being well-motivated, three knowledgeable reviewers find the paper not ready yet for publication at ICLR. The AC recommends a rejection, given the standing major concerns from the reviewers. The AC is hopeful that the paper can be significantly improved by 

- sufficiently discussing and highlighting the novel insights of the results. 
- a more rigorous definition of  "novel" vs. "irrelevant" inputs. There seem to be overlapping definitions between what Hsu et al. considered vs. this paper. In particular,  Hsu et al distinguish i) samples of a novel class but in a known domain, called semantic shift (S), and ii) samples of known class in a novel domain, called non-semantic shift (NS), both of which are reconsidered in this paper. Therefore, the novelty of this submission is more precisely to distinguish within the category of semantic shift. The AC agrees that this might deem some more rigorous measurement and definition of "semantic closeness". 
- The AC also finds the evaluation of domain shift in Section 3.3.2 may be potentially misleading the community, as it falls out of the standard OOD scope. The notion of common corruption is closer to the robustness problem (which is how ML model predictions changes w.r.t some delta changes in the input space). The changes may not be substantial enough to be "out-of-distribution".

Adversarial training in linear neural networks is a corollary to Theorem 5. The paper's results place a milestone in the theory of adversarial robustness. The proof of Theorem 2 may have some potential errors. The results, to be honest, are not surprising, given previous works on standard training. But I believe the rigorous justification presented in the paper is of importance. It shows the implicit bias in a simplified setting with a deep linear neural network and linearly separable data.

The reviews are divided: three reviews give a score of 7 (accept) whereas one review gives a score of 4 (borderline reject). The positive reviews cite the following strengths: clearly stated motivation, technical soundness, potential for impact and convincing experiments. The negative review cites lack of clarity as the main weakness (something also mentioned in one of the positive reviews), while the reviewer is not convinced about the originality of the method given similar advances in variational inference and generative modelling.

On balance, given the potential of impact in the field of predictive coding and the technical soundness, I'm happy to recommend acceptance, even though clarity is somewhat lacking.

Some reviewers requested more details on computational complexity, memory consumption and scalability. I encourage the authors to use the extra content page in the camera-ready version to discuss these aspects further.

This paper advances the long running thread of sequence modelling research focussed on differentiable instantiations of stack based models. In particular it builds upon recent work on the Nondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN) by introducing three extensions. The first is to relax the need for a normalised distribution over the state and action distribution and allow unnormalised weights, this mostly serves to facilitate gradient flow and thus easier training. The second extension allows the RNN to condition on the top stack state as well as the symbol, improving expressiveness. The third improvement introduces a method for limiting the memory required to run the proposed model on long sequences, thus allowing its application to practical language modelling tasks. Each of these requires substantial algorithmic innovations.

The reviewers all agree that this is a strong paper worthy of publication. The paper includes a useful review of previous differentiable stack models which nicely sets up the rest of the paper where the contributions are well motivated and clearly presented. The reviewers had a number of clarification questions, partly due to the author's use of overly concise citations for key algorithms rather than inline descriptions. This situation has been improved by updates made to the paper.
The evaluation includes a series of synthetic experiments which are clear and provide a good elucidation of the various stack models properties. The practical evaluation on language modelling is more limited and serves mostly to demonstrate that the nondeterministic model can be scaled to a basic language modelling task.

Overall this is a strong paper with a well motivated and clear hypothesis. It provides a substantial extension to the prior work on nondeterministic stack models and progresses this line of research toward practical applications.

Reviewers were mixed about this paper. The stand-out concern is clearly the fact that this paper does very little to set itself in context. I would echo these concerns, and this is clearly the single greatest weakness of the paper. For example I would highlight lines 54--62, in which the proposed technique is compared only against some nebulously-defined "other".

Despite these concerns, I am inclined to agree with reviewer QEo4 that the paper is acceptable for a workshop, and would strongly encourage the authors to address the concerns raised by reviewers.

In addition to the review comments, a few comments of my own:

- Equation (2) assumes that the SDE is solved via the Euler--Maruyama method. Whilst analytically convenient, I believe it is more elegant to treat the general case for as long as possible (without reducing to just the EM method at this early stage). If the noise has particular structure then it may become desirable to solve the SDE via some more efficient numerical method, e.g. Milstein if using commutative noise or Heun if using additive noise (Heun converges to the Stratonovich solution, but for additive noise then Itô and Stratonovich are identical).
- I think equation (2) may be missing a $t_{n+1}-t_n$ coefficient for the $f$ term.
- The "not too far" of line 67 is usually referred to as a "trust region".

The paper asks how we should interpolate in the latent space. The key idea is to derive a natural interpolant from the prior distribution p(z), where z is the latent variable. The authors show that the Cauchy distribution has such a property, however due to the heavy-tails is not particularly useful. In addition, they propose a non-linear interpolation that naturally has this property. I have some concerns about the idea itself (see below), yet find that the paper brings an interesting new idea to the table.

All the reviewers and AC agrees that the main strength of the paper that it studies a rather important question of the validity of using linear interpolation in evaluating GANs. The paper gives concrete examples and theoretical and empirical analysis that shows linear interpolation is not a great idea. The potential weakness is that the paper doesn't provide a very convincing new evaluation to replace the linear interpolation. However, given that it's largely unclear what are the right evaluations for GANs, the AC thinks the "negative result" about linear interpolation already deserves an ICLR paper.

The authors hope to explore a more efficient/reasonable masking strategy for training masked autoencoders (MAEs) Their intuition is that current masking strategies (e.g., random masking) cannot utilize semantic information contained in images. To achieve this, an iBOT-pretrained ViT is used to extract the features, and then StyleGAN-based decoder is trained to learn semantic parts. The paper claims that semantic parts of objects are the visual analogue of words.

Gold Metareview 181:
Authors present a method attempting to perform Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) using semantic knowledge, to try to better approximate the semantic MAE seen in language domain. To do this, they leverage an iBOT framework and add some embeddings of the class token to create "part tokens", which are then compared to patch tokens from iBOT to produce attention maps. The objective for this process is a StyleGAN-based image reconstruction.

Once the part attention maps training is done, the network is then used to guide semantic based part masking based on the generated attention maps, for semantic MAE.  

SemMAE pretrained networks are then compared against other forms of SSL pretraining on ImageNet 1k, iNa, CUB, Cars, and ADE-20K, demonstrating improvements in all domains.

Pros:
- [R] Idea is interesting / novel
- [R] Well written
- [AC/R] Results improve over baselines	
	

Cons:
- [AC/R] Pipeline is complicated.
- [R] What about starting from random MAE and then adapting based on parts knowledge? Authors respond that this is future work.
- [AC/R] Not convinced parts are visual analog of words. Authors provide benchmark improvements in performance, and qualitative visualization of the parts. However, there is no quantitative assessment of the parts and whether they have true semantic meaning.
- [AC/R] Some improvements are marginal. Authors respond that although marginal in some cases, they are consistent. 
- [R] Paper does not discuss more how to deal with background. Authors respond that this is future work.

Overall, all reviewers have changed their assessments to accept, including the one reject reviewer. AC recommends accept, though would be preferable if quantitative assessment of the quality of the semantic parts (for example, by segmentation masks) could be provided.

This is a well written paper proposing a quantitative framework to expand the inferences that can be done in the study of the causal effects of task stimuli on brain signals. The considered problem is interesting and important. The proposed metrics are intuitively reasonable. Although the considered problem has some "causal flavour", I feel that the proposed method is rather irrelevant to causality. I am not sure whether this paper would be a good fit for this conference.

The authors develop two metrics for evaluating how different brain zones may be affected by the same stimuli. The framework created shows promising results when applied to actual and simulated data. This is a well-written paper with a particular application in mind. It designs a framework for discussing causal effects for applications in neuroscience. This paper's developed metrics and framework are potentially impactful and present a promising start for future research in this direction. The reviewers and I found the author's replies and rebuttal especially helpful in reaching our decision, so I hope some of these comments and arguments are included in the final version of the paper.

Minor comment: In addition to the comments made by the reviewers below, I would encourage the authors to make the references more consistent. At the moment some authors' first names are included and others are not.

The paper intends to utilize natural gradient induced by Wasserstein-2 distance to train the generator in GAN. The motivation is clear but by so many steps of approximation and relaxation, the authors didn’t address what is the final regularization actually corresponding to. The proposal provides an easy-to-implement drop-in regularizer framework. The paper is head over heels. It can be caricatured as extreme obfuscation. I encourage more simulation studies and take more GAN structures into consideration.

Gold Metareview 184:
To address the problem of unauthorized use of data, methods are proposed to make data unlearnable for deep learning models by adding a type of error-minimizing noise. Based on th fact that the conferred unlearnability is found fragile to adversarial training, the authors design new methods to generate robust unlearnable examples that are protected from adversarial training. In addition, considering the vulnerability of error-minimizing noise in adversarial training, robust error-minimizing noise is then introduced to reduce the adversarial training loss.
The authors have tried to respond to reviewers' comments along with adding more experiments.
Overall, this manuscript finally gets three positive reviews and one negative review, where the possible vulnerability or robustness of error-minimizing noise against (simple) image processing operations was not verified.
In comparison with other manuscripts I'm handling that got consistent positive comments, this manuscript is still recommended to be accepted (poster) with a further study of robustness under simple image transformations in the final version.

The method is well organized and well written. Only weakness that I can think of is that improvement may be only in a context of 2.5D vs 3D. Methodological development is well motivated and clearly written. Experiments are well defined, and results are presented well. The paper is missing comparison against a V-Net architecture trained on patches used for learning global representation. The method uses a randomized scheme for extracting patches, self-enforcing and spatial ensembling.

This paper investigates the regret analysis of a particular form of reward shaping. The shaping function is an approximation of the optimal state value function. This reward shaping is integrated into an extension of the UCBVI algorithm. The paper addresses a very relevant and useful question, and it provides a convincing and competent answer. The theoretical investigation in this paper is relevant and timely. Empirical evaluation on three domains is also provided, and the experiments confirm the merit of the contribution.

The reviewers carefully analyzed this work and agreed that the topics investigated in this paper are important and relevant to the field. Overall, the reviewers had a generally positive impression of this paper. One reviewer argued that this paper addresses a relevant and valuable question and makes an important step towards a better understanding of regret when reward shaping is used. Even though this paper makes assumptions that were of some concern to other reviewers, this reviewer argued that the paper is nonetheless an important milestone for the community. Another reviewer acknowledged that this paper conducted a formal theoretical investigation of the impact of reward shaping methods on the sample complexity of RL algorithms and argued that all proofs seem to be sound. This reviewer had a few technical questions, which were all addressed by the authors. Post-rebuttal, the reviewer encouraged the authors to incorporate the corresponding details (such as those discussed in the rebuttal) in the updated version of their draft. A third reviewer emphasized that this paper shed light on reward shaping from a theoretical perspective. They argued that the quality and scientific soundness of the paper are objectively excellent, that the paper is original, and that it deserves merit. The reviewer pointed out one main weakness, however, regarding the assumption of the type of the shaped reward function. They wondered whether this assumption could limit the impact and applicability of the paper's results. After reading the authors' thorough rebuttal, however, the reviewer stated that they were satisfied with all responses and updated their score accordingly. Finally, a fourth reviewer also had an overall positive view of this work but pointed out, as a weakness, the seemingly strong assumption that the shaping signal is an approximation of the optimal value function. After reading the authors' response, however, the reviewer stated that the assumptions made in this paper were not as restrictive as they initially thought, and updated their score. Overall, thus, it seems like most reviewers were positively impressed with the quality of this work. They look forward to an updated paper version addressing the suggestions mentioned in their reviews and during the discussion phase.

The problem of testing the closeness of distributions asks to distinguish two cases for input distributions $P,Q$ The most natural setting for a testing algorithm is to only allow black-box sample access to $P$ and $Q$. However, it is known that this requires the sample complexity to be exponential in $n$. In this submission, the authors present an algorithm, Pacoco, that has sample complexity $tilde{O} ($n - 11.6 \epsilon) + n / \eta^2)

This submission studies (a somewhat non-standard version of) tolerant closeness testing of distributions over the n-dimensional hypercube. Instead of only iid samples, it is assumed that the tester is able to efficiently evaluate the probability mass at any point in the domain and to sample from the distribution conditioned on any subset of size two of the domain. The main result is
an algorithm with query complexity scaling near-linearly in the dimension. Using only iid samples, one would need exponential dependence on dimension. The algorithm is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets. It is experimentally shown that their algorithm outperforms a previous baseline, which in the worst case has complexity scaling exponentially in the dimension. Overall, this is an interesting work that appears to meet the bar for acceptance.

The paper proposes a framework to perform signal processing tasks on a signal represented with an implicit neural representation directly in the representation space, without the need to instantiate the signal. 

After the rebuttal period, all reviewers recommend acceptance. 

In particular reviewer 1Yx6, an expert on the topic, finds the idea original, and the quality and clarity of the paper to be high. The reviewer finds that while for now the significance is limited (since working as proposed in the representation space is computationally prophibitavely expensive), this is not a major issue, since the the paper is likely to inspire work that will push the idea further. 
Reviesers edqT and qGk1 also liked the general idea of the paper and find the proposed method to directly perform operations on the representation space of implicit neural representations to be novel and interesting

Reviewer Uh51 initially identified a few issues regarding experimental design, the validation, and on the included literature. The main concern regarding the experimental design of the reviewer was that the paper focuses on images (and not signal processing tasks more broadly), which I don't consider a shortcoming, due to the importance of image processing tasks. The concerns on the validation issues have been addressed as well, and the reviewer raised their score. 

I recommend acceptance of the paper.

The main result from the theorem is that the error gap of norm constrained embeddeddings scales as O(d^-0.5(lnn)0. 5) The authors find that the term in the bound that represents the function complexity involves the norm of the learnt coordinates.

This paper provides a generalization analysis for graph embedding methods concluding with the observation that the norm of the embedding vectors provides an effective regularization, more so than dimensionality alone. The main theoretical result is backed up by several experiments.  While the result appears to be correct, norm control, dimensionality reduction and early stopping during optimization are all very well studied in machine learning as effective regularizers, either operating alone or in conjunction. The regularization parameters, iteration count, embedding dimensionality is typically tuned for an application. The AC agrees with Reviewer 2 that the paper does not provide sufficiently interesting insights beyond this observation and is unlikely to influence practical applications of these methods.   Both reviewer 2 and 3 have also raised points on the need for stronger empirical analysis.

The paper considers the stochastic proximal point algorithm, the main contribution is a convergence proof (in addition to arguing that it is a practical algorithm for ERM problems).  However, reviewer EvJ6 and xJB8 pointed out a fatal flaw in Lemma 1 that affects all the downstream results, and the other two reviewers and myself agree that this invalidates the core results. Reviewer EvJ6 gives extensive examples of how the lemma cannot be simply fixed. So while this is an interesting stochastic extension of the famous deterministic method and may warrant further study, this paper doesn't yet provide a rigorous convergence proof.

On the one hand, there is a general agreement that the empirical results suggesting that spectral clustering-based method can be competitive with SOTA methods on node classification benchmark is an interesting result. One the other hand, reviewers did not find a significantly novel contribution in the methodology proposed, and found that the empirical evaluation lacks depth and details to be really informative (eg, to understand why some methods work or not on some benchmarks). There is therefore a consensus that the paper is not ready for ICLR in its current form, but we hope that the reviews and discussion will help the authors prepare a revised version in the future.

This paper extends the idea of hindsight experience replay (HER) to learn Q functions with relative goals by constructing a distribution over relative goals sampled from a replay buffer using a clustering algorithm. This approach is evaluated on three multi-goal RL environments and is shown to learn faster than baselines.

2. Interesting use of clustering in the context of HER but this choice is made without strong justifications or formal arguments

Some of the key choices made in this paper are not justified or explained property, e.g. - the goal sampling strategy, choices made in the clustering algorithm and associated heuristics, implicit assumptions (e.g. R1 raised the question of using L2 distance in measuring metrics between two states) 
2. There are several choices made without sufficient formal arguments, verification or guarantees.

Equilibrium propagation is a biologically plausible form of backpropagation based learning where the true gradient of an energy based model is computed for infinitesimal perturbations. In this innovative work, authors extend EP using complex analysis that links contour integrals for finite perturbations with the oscillatory dynamics in time.

It represents a significant advance that opens new doors.

As opposed to the standard setting, the planner does not know the realized valuation at each period. The paper proposes an interesting mechanism to overcome the ignorance of the valuation distribution. However, this approach is hampered by its reliance on the iid assumption. This work is thus the first to propose an approximate BIC policy, with sublinear regret, when neither of these conditions hold.

Executive summary:

The authors study the repeated allocation of an identical good over T rounds to n strategic buyers in a "no monetary transfers" setting. The buyers have i.i.d. valuations drawn from an unknown distribution, and the algorithm must work with reported valuations. The goal is to maximize social welfare (= sum of valuations) under the constraint that each buyer receives a pre-specified fraction of the total number of goods. 

The main result is an algorithm for this problem that ensures two things: 

(a) approximate Bayesian incentive compatibility (approx-BIC) (Definition 2 and Theorem 1) and 

(b) low individual regret (Definition 3 and Theorem 2). 

The key idea of the algorithm (is to exploit the iid-ness of the problem) and detect misreports from the underlying CDF using Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz type bounds.

Discussion and recommendation:

After some initial set back on the problem motivation, the reviewers bought into the motivation for studying this online allocation problem "without monetary transfers" (adding examples such as the foodbank example might be good).  

There was some discussion around "assuming iid valuations" limiting the generality of the result, but there is in fact a history of papers that studies learning with strategic agents under this assumption (eg Kanoria and Nazerzadeh 2021).

The main difference of the current work is that it's working in a setting without money.

The idea behind the algorithm is maybe "the obvious think to do" - but of course it still requires some work to formally prove that it actually works. 

I think one thing that could strengthen the paper would be to add some discussion around the tightness/non-tightness of the approximate BIC and individual regret bounds.

Weak accept.

Gold Metareview 201:
This paper presents a knowledge distillation method for face recognition, by inheriting the teacher’s classifier as the student’s classifier and optimizing the student model with advanced loss functions. It received comments from three reviewers: 1 rated “Ok but not good enough - rejection”, 1 rated “Marginally below” and 1 rated “Marginally above”. The reviewers appreciate the simple yet clear methodology illustration and the well written paper. However, a number of major concerns are raised by the reviewers, including limited novelty, lack of comparison with more advanced knowledge distillation methods and their special case in face recognition. During the rebuttal, the authors made efforts to response to all reviewers’ comments. However, the rating were not changed. The ACs concur these major concerns and more comprehensive comparisons with the state of the art KD methods are necessary to better illustrate the contribution of this work. Therefore, this paper can not be accepted at its current state.

NormGrad is a saliency detection method used in medical image analysis. The authors intended to demonstrate the superiority of normGrad for IQA in chest x-Rays versus other techniques. The paper is generally well written, the literature review is expansive and covers the state of the art well. The evaluation of hyperparameters as well as the comparison of NormGrad to other methods is sound and extensive. It would be great to see more examples in the appendix.

The paper receives unanimously positive reviews from four knowledgeable experts. They all agree that, though the saliency detection method NormGrad is not invented by the authors, its use in the context of medical image analysis shows promising results, which is clearly demonstrated by the authors. They also express some concerns, which are largely addressed by the authors in the discussions. I, therefore, recommend the acceptance of this paper.

The paper presents an interesting mathematical derivation that drives the subsequent approach based on reducing classifier discrepancy. The theoretical parts of the paper are very poorly written and peppered with unexplained notations. Despite those problems, the logical flow is good so the paper is acceptably readable. The proposed method, Reducing Classifier Discrepancy, has two training phases. Empirical results show the benefits of the proposed method on three few-shot datasets.

This paper proposes a contribution aiming at understanding the cause of errors in few-shot learning. The motivation is interesting but the reviewers pointed out many aspects that require more precisions and polishing in addition to the fact that the upper bound provided it rather loose. The rebuttal provided addresses some concerns, but there are still some remarks that require some clarifications en work.
Hence, I propose rejection.

This paper proposes to reverse-engineer the trojan in the feature space of DNNs. The proposed method can be used to detect feature-based trojan or dynamic trojan that is input dependent. Results on four datasets and seven different attacks demonstrate that the proposed method effectively defends both input-space and feature-space Trojans. This paper provides a unique insight that Trojan features will form a hyperplane in the high dimensional space.

There was a fair amount of discussion about the paper.  Several reviewers felt that the paper would have been stronger if it tried to do less but better.  The reviews describe in detail what the reviewers would have found compelling, but the key suggestion is to remove the complexity that is not essential for the approach to provide consistent improvements.  Doing this requires a better understanding of the algorithm's behavior and a valid ablation study, a new concern raised during the discussion with the authors. 

The reviewers felt that the proposed approach is potentially interesting and would like to see this paper done well.

The paper studies how the diversity of tasks in the training phase affects the performance of meta-learning algorithms. The paper finds negative evidence, which is consistent with Setlur et al. (2021) Compared with the existing work, the paper performs more extensive experiments with different algorithms, task samplers, and different datasets. The findings indicate that increasing task diversity during the meta-training process does not boost performance. It does not do a good job in explaining why some of the sampling methods work better than others.

This paper set out to show that increasing task diversity during meta-training process does not boost performance. The reviewers mostly  agreed (only reviewer wVFn dissented) that the empirical set up of the paper was convincing, but they also felt it over-emphasized empirics over a deeper understanding of the phenomena observed. In turn, this resulted in discussions around how the experiments and the explanations didn't fully prove that increasing task diversity does not help. Overall, the discussion and the additional analysis tools provided by the authors (such as the diversity metric) will greatly improve the paper.

This paper suggests to model outliers using a CVAE. It then suggests simple scoring functions for incorporating these simulated outlier into a classifier. A numerical comparison shows this method is able to outperform CSI on a couple of datasets. In the majority of setups, CGA shows competitive performance against the conventional OOD detection methods. The paper is well written, covers the related works, and importantly, is well motivated. The authors proposed to use a Conditional VAE in order to generate pseudo OOD data, which can be used to improve OOD Detection.

Gold Metareview 209:
The article introduces a Bayesian approach for online learning in non-stationary environments. The approach, which bears similarities with weighted likelihood estimation methods, associate a binary weight to each past observation, indicating if this observation should be including or not to compute the posterior. The weights are estimated via maximum a posteriori. 

The paper is well written, the approach is novel and its usefulness demonstrated on a number of different experiments. The original submission missed some relevant references that have been added in the revision. The approach has some limitations, highlighted by the reviewers:
* it requires to solve a binary optimisation problem whose complexity scales exponentially with the size of the dataset; although the greedy procedure proposed by the authors seems to work fine on the examples shown, the approach may not be applicable to larger datasets
* it requires to store all the data
* it requires the traceability of the marginal likelihood

Despite these limitations, there was a general agreement that this paper offers a novel and useful contribution, and I recommend acceptance. 

As noted by reviewer o4TK, I also think that the title is not very accurate. Bayesian methods naturally allow recursive updates of one's beliefs, and therefore have "memory". Maybe change the title for "Bayes with augmented selective/adaptive memory"?

This is an interesting contribution to the Boltzmann machine (BM) literature that makes a nice connection to DEQ models. On a positive note, reviewers found that it was well-written, clear, and interesting. Unfortunately, there were significant concerns with the manuscript that were not fully addressed in the revision: inappropriate or incomplete baselines, insufficient credit given to previous works, and the fact that this model is limited as compared to its BM relatives.

I would recommend that the authors take into account the reviewers' feedback in a revision of the work.

The method seems hard to scale to large and complex images.

The paper introduces a new approach for generative modeling: a diffusion process is run until it first hits a target set, and then outputs the first point that is hit. 

Three reviewers generally praised the originality, technical quality, and empirical results of the paper. They found the idea very interesting and novel, and technically sound. The numerical results were judged to be compelling and fair. One concern was clarity of exposition. There seemed to be two issues: (1) there were more typos and rough edges than expected, (2) more significantly, there was some difficulty in following all details of the main method given the notational complexity and significant amount of mathematical background on diffusion processes. Reviewer FUwB gave a number of concrete suggestions for improvement.

Reviewer wpmu had a negative overall opinion and critiqued the originality, quality, and clarity. On these issues: (1) the quality concern was based on a misunderstanding that was later resolved, (2) the originality concern does not seem justified to the meta-reviewer (it is based on a shared technical tool with a not-yet-published paper), and (3) the clarity concern is similar to those raised by other reviewers (especially FUwB). Overall, the meta-reviewer does not feel that the low score (3 = “reject”) was fully justified. 

In summary, overall reviewers found the paper sound and novel, with the main area for improvement being clarity of exposition about diffusion processes; one reviewer considered originality a weakness, but the meta-reviewer did not find this position well justified.

This paper proposes reducing slip during dynamic motions by adapting the trajectory, specifically decreasing the velocity. This is in contrast to previous papers which normally focus on moderating gripping force. Reactive Slip Control (RSC) outperforms PSC, since it can plan to prevent slip before it occurs. The key idea is to learn a slip prediction model that takes tactile sensor data and planned future actions as input and outputs an estimation of whether the object is going to slip.

In this paper, the authors show the effect of RNI on the expressive power of GNN for the first time, where the RNI was initially proposed in Sato et al. 2020.

The key concern was that the novelty over the Sato's paper and the reviewers were still not convinced by the response. Therefore, the paper is still below the acceptance threshold.  I strongly encourage authors to revise the paper based on the reviewer's comments and resubmit it to a future venue.

They observe that discouraging selectivity can have a small benefit and generally doesn't harm performance even at very high values.

This paper describes a new batching strategy for more efficient training of deep neural nets. The idea stems from the observation that some operations can only be batched more efficiently in the backward, suggesting that batching should be different between forward and backward. The results show that the proposed method improves upon existing batch strategies across three tasks. The reviewers find the work novel, but note that it does not properly address the trade-offs made by the technique - such as memory consumption. They also argue that the writing should be improved before acceptance at ICLR.

This paper investigates the role of representation learning when the distribution over the feature space has a long tail. The main motivation is to determine how much of the overall learning, in this case, is bottlenecked specifically by representation learning. The main findings are that vanilla learning gives brittle long-tailed representations, harming overall performance. The paper suggests a form of data augmentation to remedy this. Reviewers acknowledge that this investigation is worthwhile. However, many concerns were raised as to whether experiments support the drawn conclusions. A more principled approach to the data augmentation methodology is also needed. The authors address some of these, providing further experiments, but these were not enough to sway reviewers. Since results are fundamentally empirical in nature, this shortcoming indicates that the paper is not ready to share with the community just yet. Stronger experiments with clearer evidence are needed to fully support the thesis of the work.

This condensation restricts the capacity of NNs at the beginning, working as implicit regularization. The paper presents several typos and unclear sentences in the current form. Broadly, this work is intriguing, but could stand to benefit from a few improvements, suggested below.

Two reviewers consider this article marginally above and two more marginally below the acceptance threshold. I find the article draws an interesting connection pertaining an interesting topic. However, the reviews and discussion conclude that the article lacks in several regards that in my view still could and should be improved. Therefore I am recommending reject at this time. I encourage the authors to revise and resubmit.

This is one of the first papers doing BERT-style pretraining for vision transformers. This approach is inspired by the contrastive self-supervised learning approach like DINO and the mask modelling approach like BeiT. The paper is quite well written, the method is simple and gives better performance than DINO. Nevertheless, the comparison between the different approaches does not seem to be complete enough.

The paper is interesting, and its focus is timely and important, given the continuing rapid rise of transformers (and their dependence of tokenization of images). All three reviewers recommend acceptance, to varying degree. The paper will be a valuable contribution to the program at ICLR.

Using O(n polylog ) images one can recover all private images in the InstaHide challenge. However, the running time of the algorithm is exponential in the number of private images. The authors provide a solid solution for a problem with limited scope. In the current form, I believe the value for the general readers are limited, therefore I would recommend for weak reject. The paper makes reasonable improvements to the sample complexity of the challenge.

All reviewers agree that this is a reasonable contribution but that it is also extremely limited in scope. The authors suggest in one of their response that their technique could apply to "any data mixing method with “batched k-sum” structure". Such a larger level of generality might make the paper more interesting, but at the moment it is an extremely niche result.

This paper provides tools for classifying the payoff dynamics in general-sum n-player games as Lyapunov chaotic. The main text chops on Theorem 11 without any discussion on this theorem after. The paper could benefit from additional discussion and explanation of the claims (see below)This paper studies the chaos phenomena of learning in general normal-form games beyond zero-sum and coordination games. It appears to extend earlier work by Cheung and Piliouras to more general- sum settings.
Gold Metareview 227:
This paper looks at chaos in learning in games, extending a line of work in two players zero-sum games (that I found quite restrictive in the past). It somehow reduces the class of more general games to zero-sum and cooperative games (this decomposition is already known) so that the techniques can be transposed here.

The paper is interesting, yet sometimes difficult to follow, and I am not certain that it gives many new insights. 

Nonetheless, we believe its quality justify acceptance.

MemUP is a method to learn long-term dependencies for recurrent models. It learns to keep useful past states for future use, so it saves both computation and memory. Empirical experiments on supervisied learning and reinforcement learning tasks show that MemUP significantly boost the results over its baselines. The idea behind the method is clear and interesting, but could have make a better job exploring it further. The authors leverage a memory model to predict future outcomes with high uncertainty. By skipping all states with lower uncertainty, the training process takes less computational cost in backpropagation.

The reviewers found the ideas presented in the paper interesting -- the use of mutual information to train memory for a model, and the clear presentation. Some questions were raised about demonstrating on a more elaborate set up such as NLP tasks -- the main experiments aside from the toy experiments of copy, etc algorithmic tasks, seem to be on RL experiments, but the method has been advertised more broadly in the motivation. Another reviewer raised the question of the complexity of training multiple networks. Nevertheless, the reviewers found the paper interesting enough to recommend a weak accept and I support that recommendation.

From a reviewers lens, I was a little surprised that the paper made no mention of prior works on maximizing mutual information between features of neural networks to improve results. As an example, see the following paper [1] that uses a mutual information regularizer between states at different steps of a recurrent neural networks. There is also a rich literature of doing so for convolutional neural networks. It would have made sense to compare how the idea in the paper performed in comparison to these methods (and in a sense the ablation study which looked at randomly choosing time steps, k, (regardless of the uncertainty estimator) is an experiment in this direction). I understand that part of the paper deals with the choice of time points to increase mutual information between, and so its probably more efficient than the other alternatives, but a comparison (or discussion in related works) would have made the paper stronger.

Overall, all reviewers see the novelty in the dataset that provides an original new set of tactile data, accounting for a wide range of objects and scene, collected in the wild. The paper is overall well written, clear and easy to follow, and provides a good demonstration of the importance and usefulness of the dataset, going beyond datasets collected by robots in the context of material properties. It also includes initial steps towards benchmarking, although it is not the core contribution of the paper, which lies in the creation of the dataset itself. 

Two reviewers recommend acceptance, two stand marginally below acceptance, and one does recommend rejection. The authors have provided detailed responses to all reviewers’ comments and concerns and updated their manuscript. The main concerns of those reviewers sitting on the fence seem to be answered and limitations acknowledged however the element of bias in the data collection was still considered as a possible concern. Based on my reading and accounting for the authors changes, there approach itself is novel and original and hence provides already a relevant contribution to NeuroIPS; while the authors acknowledge limitations and future work avenues. The one reviewer recommending rejection didn’t engage in the discussion but from my reading of both the paper, the comments, and the authors responses, I believe the main points were addressed by the authors and misunderstandings clarified. Overall, I believe the papers offers a novel, non-existing dataset that can inspire interesting future works; all the dataset is shared and presented clearly for others to use.

This paper proposes a method VAEL, which combines VAE and ProbLog. The main idea is to interpret a subset of the latent representation z of VAE as symbolic representation of the input. A neural network maps z_sym to probabilities of facts in a ProbLog program. VAEL is tested on two image generation tasks and is shown to have better generalization. This work propose to unify unify VAE with probabilistic logic programming, which is an original problem to investigate.

The paper proposes to include a component enforcing logical constraints on top of a variational autoencoder (VAE). The resulting method, VAEL. does so by leveraging ProbLog in addition to a neural encoder and decoder. VAEL is employed for simple generative tasks with constraints over the outputs, such as conditional image generation with MNIST and small Mario levels.

The reviewers have appreciated the direction where VAEL is heading and the importance of integrating constraints in deep generative models. Some concerns are still open. Specifically, the motivation behind some architectural choices (and the specific choice of VAEs as deep generative models) and the small-scale nature of the experiments. The complexity and scaling campabilities of performing symbolic reasoning with ProbLog are not discussed in depth.

Experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing models on seven benchmark datasets.

The paper is generally easy to follow and the idea of using pathway in recommendation algorithms seems to be new.

This paper presents Recommender Transformer (RETR) with a pathway attention mechanism that can dynamically zeroing-out the interactions (e.g., the trivial/noisy ones) in transformer-based sequential recommender systems. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. 

Overall this paper received mixed reviews with borderline scores. The reviewers raised concerns around baselines and evaluations, some of which the authors promptly addressed in the revision during the rebuttal period. I also read the paper in details myself. I do agree with some of the concerns from the reviewers but I don't think a method needs to beat every other published papers to be published (and I think the current baselines are more than thorough enough). My biggest complaint about the paper is around the writing, specifically, how the proposed idea is presented. 

This paper tries to tackle an important question, which is that in sequential recommendation, not every interactions are useful in helping predict future interaction. The self-attention mechanism in transformer kind of addresses this problem but in a more "softer" fashion with attention weights. This paper presents a simple yet effective method to introduce a pathway mechanism that adaptively zeroing-out some of the interactions via a binary pathway router. In order to train such a model end-to-end, Gumbel-softmax sampling is utilized.

The most important part of the contribution to me is that this is an improvement to the transformer architecture, as opposed to a new model which is what this paper's writing suggests -- the proposed approach is effectively model-agonistic and doesn't marry to a particular loss function or finer-grained architectural choices (number of layers, etc.). Currently there are many baselines in the paper, but each made some different model/architecture choices, which could contribute to the difference in performance (or not, but we wouldn't know). An ideal evaluation should have been to take all the transformer-based baselines that are currently in the paper, add this pathway mechanism without changing anything else, and show that the results improved over the transformer architecture. In this way, we know the improvements are exactly coming from introducing the pathway. The authors might argue some of the current results are already supporting this argument, but my point is to emphasize this point very explicitly rather than leaving it for the readers to infer. 

From what I read in this paper, I truly believe this pathway idea has its potential. Therefore, I would especially want the authors to further refine the presentation to better convey the idea, which in turn will hopefully increase the impact of this paper once it is eventually published. 

Some minor comments:
* The way the paper is currently written seems to suggest there are only three types of pathways and the network is capable of capturing all of them. I am personally not a big of fan of over-interpreting what a neural net is trying to do. Therefore, I wouldn't overly focus on the characterization of different pathways and only show the qualitative examples at the end as a high-level demonstration.
* In Eq 2 "softmax" should really be "sigmoid" if a 0-1 prediction is made there. Then the following line "logit" is probably not the right word here. 
* The qualitative examples at the end (figure 3) can be more carefully examined/labeled. For example, the current categorization is quite ambiguous -- "Indie" refers to the type of developers while "JPG" refers to the genre of the game, they are certainly not mutually exclusive.

The method is mathematically rigorous with a strong theoretical analysis and excellent empirical results across multiple continual learning benchmarks. It is a clear accept.

The authors are encouraged to make sure that these points are addressed in the final version of the paper.

The reviewers have improved their scores after the rebuttal, and I agree that the work has value. It proposes a model-driven data augmentation approach to environment-invariant graph representation. Just like most data augmentation works in graph representation learning, the approach relies on graph proposal generator. The work has an implicit mechanism hidden in the graph generator (the authors' reply to a reviewer that "we target the extrapolation via a new invariant learning approach that is agnostic to specific GNN models" is a misunderstanding of why & how these types of methods work). The submission could significantly improve the introduction by properly describing the work w.r.t. other OOD efforts in graph representation learning. While the tasks of different works may be different (e.g., graph classification vs node classification), it is important to emphasize what each different approach brings to the table (rather than just state that the tasks are different). I hope the authors take this opportunity to improve the introduction. This work is more similar to the former OOD graph representation works than IRM & REX, since (without modeling assumptions) both IRM and REX require the support of the environments in test to be a subset of the ones in training. The present work does not need this support assumption since it uses an implicit mechanism in the graph generator.

The toy example in Section 3.1 is informative, thank you. The theory looks solid and easy to understand. The technical novelty is limited, since once the input graph has been decomposed into a set of ego-graphs the definitions, formulations, and theory are all straightforward adaptations from the respective versions for IID data.

- In Assumption 2, m() should be defined inside the assumption.

It proposes TMG-NMT, namely Translation Memory Guided NMT, which consists of two parts, a universal memory encoder and a TM guided decoder.

Gold Metareview 234:
This paper presents a way to use a translation memory (TM) to improve neural machine translation.  Basically the proposed model uses a n-gram retrieve matching sentence （or pieces） and takes advantage of the useful parts using gated attention and copying mechanism.  Although the idea of leveraging TM in the context of NMT is not new,  this work seems to be a fair contribution. My major concerns are the following
1. The retrieval part  is not clearly presented, raising questions about  complexities and the noise brought by the common words. The authors should give a better exposition on the ranking mechanism. 
2. The experiments are not convincing enough since the proposed model is not compared to the SOTA and the competitive models described in the prior work.

In conclusion I would suggest to reject this paper.

The proposed approach is only marginally better than MLE-based model fitting. I would have liked to see an evaluation on more datasets. The claim that that the proposed approach constitutes the first time a scoring rule other than maximum likelihood seems too strong, unnecessary and irrelevant to the value of the presented work. It is not clear how did the authors handle the irregularity (in time) of EHR encounters in the context of an RNN specification.

Although the authors mention that they want to make their dataset particularly useful for academics/future research, I believe, that the topic is of great interest for companies, making the raised ethical considerations even more important.

However, I appreciated that the authors have done a fantastic job in their response and strengthening their article. Moreover, all reviewers recognise the utility and relevance of the proposed dataset and the authors did provide satisfactory responses to all raised concerns/comments.

The paper presents a new method for generation of backdoor attacks against deep networks. The new method uses global warping instead of noise patches which makes the attack much more stealthy than previous approaches. The attack effectiveness is demonstrated on 3 benchmark datasets.

The new attack is a novel and original contribution which is likely to advance the understanding of backdoor attacks. There were some issues with respect to clarity in the original manuscript but the authors adequately addressed the critical remarks raised by the reviewers.

The paper proposes a method to improve adversarial robustness of the current convolutional networks. The method is based on dropping outputs of a fraction of neurons. Unlike in dropout masks, the masks are kept fixed throughout training/inference. This shifts the focus of the network away from texture and towards shape features. The authors argue that by doing so, the CNN is encouraged to learn less from object texture and more on features such as shape.

The paper has limited novelty and unclear analysis of the experimental results, for instance plots of accuracy vs strength of adversarial perturbation should be produced. Tables are not readable and results tend to be cluttered and confusing.  Some comparisons seem to be cherry picked as pointed out by some reviewers.
Although the approach seems to be well received by the reviewers they all shared similar concerns about having a stronger motivation and better validation of the approach (that is not amount of comparisons but the right comparisons that would clear doubts and make the work directly comparable to others).
I strongly encourage the authors to perform a deeper analysis and to clearly work on hypothesis and validation of their work. In my opinion, although the reviewers think different, the experiments are not sufficient to validate the strong claim of the paper.

The paper proposes to combine Normalizing Flows with generative Diffusion Models. The target data is first non-linearly transformed via the flow and then the distribution over latent embeddings is modeled with the diffusion model. Since the flow is invertible and defined by a deterministic function, it is possible to formally relate the combined flow and diffusion process to a non-linear diffusion directly in data space. The structure of PDM is very similar to LSGM mentioned in the related work.

Gold Metareview 243:
This paper presents a simple approach called PDM for composing non-linear and complex normalizing flows with score-based generative models. Since score-based models can be considered as a special form of continuous-time normalizing flows, PDM corresponds to a composition of different classes of normalizing flows. 

Pros: 
* Combining generic normalizing flows with score-based models is an interesting direction as they have different characteristics and can be complementary to each other.
* Using Ito's lemma to show that the model learns a non-linear SDE in data space is valuable. 
* The authors show that the variational gap can be reduced using normalizing flows.

Cons: 
* The proposed method does not exhibit a clear advantage compared to the diffusion baseline without the normalizing flow component. On the CIFAR10 dataset, the best NLL and FID results are obtained by the diffusion baseline.

* Theorem 2 makes a very unrealistic assumption that a flow network is flexible enough to transform $p_r$ to any arbitrary distribution. If this holds, we wouldn't need the score-based generation model anymore. We could simply train the normalizing flow to map the input data distribution to a Normal distribution.

* This submission chooses to discuss differences with the recent LSGM framework. However, in doing so, several inaccurate claims are made. The lack of inference data diffusion in LSGM is mentioned as one of its drawbacks. However, it is not clear what is the value of having such a mechanism and what implications it may have on the expressivity of the model. Note that mapping from data space to latent space in VAEs can be considered as a stochastic inversion rather than an exact inversion. Ito's lemma does not require invertibility and it can be easily applied to the forward and generative diffusion in LSGM. The authors argue that applying it to the forward diffusion in LSGM will result in $\hat{p_{r}}\ne p_{r}$. But, $\hat{p_{r}}$ would be only considered for visualization of the forward diffusion and it is not used for training or any other purposes. LSGM, the proposed PDM, and score-based models are all trained with a reweighting of ELBO (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02808)). It is not clear if the drawback mentioned above has an impact on the training or expressivity of the model.

* The presentation in the paper requires improvement. The motivation on why invertibility plays a key role is not clear beyond generating the visualization in Figure 2. 

In summary, the paper proposes an interesting idea and explores directions very relevant to the current focus in generative learning. However, given the concerns above, we don't believe that the paper in its current form is ready for presentation at ICLR.

The paper describes how to constrain realisations of a Gaussian process to satisfy $A f = 0$, where $A$ is a linear, matrix-valued differential operator with constant coefficients.

Generated Summary 245:
The paper describes a novel implementation of RED, regularization by denoising. The proposed implementation splits the gradient step into smaller components, which can each be executed independently on different cores and then used to update a shared copy. Numerical experiments on the CT image reconstruction have justified the proposed efficiency and significant improvement in terms of running time. However, the novelty of the methods look incremental. I would appreciate a discussion on whether this is unavoidable or if this is an open question for future work.

They propose Adaptive Gradient Variance Modulator (AGVM) - an optimizer-agnostic technique. While i have many low-level concerns about the paper positioning and quality, I am strongly in favor of paper acceptance. The paper clearly claims the motivation, which is the high gradient variance in the different modules.

The new revision of the paper has clarified several issues. The addition of past work was not well integrated. The authors do not really tackle the difficult issue of distance in the users' reaction metrics to the different effects and magnitudes. The choice of visualizations in study 2 was based on their resemblance of scatterplots. They used 16 visualizations. Which ones??? I'd like to know exactly which forms were used. It would be good to further add the number of trials seen by participants.

This paper poses and addresses the problem of language drift in multi-agent communication paradigms. When two pretrained natural-language agents are jointly optimized to communicate and solve some external non-linguistic objective, their internal communication often diverges to a code-like, unnatural communication system. This paper solves this “language drift” problem by requiring that the messages between agents be usable as inputs to an image caption retrieval system. The gains are unfortunately much weaker than I would have hoped for.

Gold Metareview 249:
This paper proposes a method to resolve "language drift," where a pre-trained X->language model trained in an X->language->Y pipeline drifts away from being natural language. In particular, it proposes to add an auxiliary training objective that performs grounding with multimodal input to fix this problem. Results are good on a task where translation is done between two languages.

The main concern that was raised with this paper by most of the reviewers is the validity of the proposed task itself. Even after extensive discussion with the authors, it is not clear that there is a very convincing scenario where we both have a pre-trained X->language, care about the intermediate results, and have some sort of grounded input to fix this drift. While I do understand the MT task is supposed to be a testbed for the true objective, it feel it is necessary to additionally have one convincing use case where this is a real problem and not just the artificially contrived. This use case could either be of practical use (e.g. potentially useful in an application), or of interest from the point of view of cognitive plausibility (e.g. similar to how children actually learn, and inspired by cognitive science literature).

A concern that offshoots from this is that because the underlying idea is compelling (some sort of grounding to inform language learning), a paper at a high-profile conference such as ICLR may help re-popularize this line of research, which has been a niche for a while. Normally I would say this is definitely a good thing; I think considering grounding in language learning is definitely an important research direction, and have been a fan of this line of work since reading Roy's seminal work on it from 15 years ago. However, if the task used in this paper, which is of questionable value and reality, becomes the benchmark for this line of work I think this might lead other follow-up work in the wrong direction.  I feel that this is a critical issue, and the paper will be much stronger after a more realistic task setting is added.

Thus, I am not recommending acceptance at this time, but would definitely like the authors to think hard and carefully about a good and realistic benchmark for the task, and follow up with a revised version of the paper in the future.

The paper proposes boosting (using Frank-Wolfe) weak RL learners to get a strong (in a concrete sense) policy. The main theoretical bound does not depend on the number of states, which indicates that the method should be competitive in very large state-space MDPs. The paper is very tersely written and not easy to understand. It is difficult to catch the main idea of this paper, and it is dubious if the proposed algorithm can be implemented in practice.
Gold Metareview 253:
The paper proposes a boosting algorithm for RL based on online boosting. The main advantage of the result is that the sample complexity does not explicitly depend on number of states. Post rebuttal, some of the reviewers have changed their opinion on the paper. However, overall the reviewers still seem to be on the fence about this paper. Seems like the paper combines the techniques from Hazan Singh’21 along with a frank-wolfe algorithm to deal with non-convex sets but the reviewers seem to view this as not as significant a new contribution. 

I see the paper as being interesting but do agree with some of the comments of the reviewers and am leaning to a reject.

The paper presents an actor critic type of method consisting of two types of features -- dynamics and tasks, in the multi-task continuous control setting. While the topic of the research is interesting and relevant to ICLR, the reviewers have concerns with the novelty and technical significance of the work. Specifically, the proposed method is very similar to several other works leading to an incremental novelty. In addition, the method is evaluated only on simple environments. The concerns remain after the discussion period. 

In the next version of the manuscript, the authors are encouraged to pursue more difficult settings and modify the method to work on those problems. That would make the paper stronger, and lead to a more novel method evaluated on harder problems.

although the idea is a straightforward extension of the usual (flat) attention mechanism (which is positive), it does show some improvement in a series of experiments done in this submission. the reviewers however found the experimental results to be rather weak and believe that there may be other problems in which the proposed attention mechanism could be better utilized, despite the authors' effort at improving the result further during the rebuttal period. this may be due to a less-than-desirable form the initial submission was in, and when the new version with perhaps a new set of more convincing experiments is reviewed elsewhere, it may be received with a more positive attitude from the reviewers.

This paper studies the stable points of gradient descent ascent with different step-sizes. The paper's main result is that for any fixed point for the GDA dynamics, that point is stable for GDA with a large enough timescale separation if and only if it is a local Stackelberg equilibrium. It seems to me that the authors have not qualitatively improved over (Jin et al. 2020) This work proves that we can get the same stability guarantees while keeping the learning rates of both players finite.

This paper treats the problem of running gradient descent-ascent (GDA) in min-max games with a different step-size for the two players. Earlier work by Jin et al. has shown that, when the ratio of the step-sizes is large enough, the stable fixed points of GDA coincide with the game's strict local min-max equilibria. The main contribution of this paper is an explicit characterization of a threshold value $\tau^*$ of this ratio as the maximum eigenvalue of a specific matrix that involves the second derivatives of the game's min-max objective at each (strict local) equilibrium.

This paper generated a fairly intense discussion, and the reviewers showed extraordinary diligence in assessing the authors' work. Specifically, the reviewers raised a fair number of concerns concerning the initial write-up of the paper, but these concerns were mostly addressed by the authors in their revision and replies. As a result, all reviewers are now in favor of acceptance.

After my own reading of both versions of the paper and the corresponding discussion, I concur with the reviewers' view and I am recommending acceptance subject to the following revisions for the final version of the paper:
1. Follow the explicit recommendations of AnonReviewer3 regarding the numerical simulations (or, failing that, remove them altogether). [The authors' phrase that "The theory we provide also does not strictly apply to using RMSprop" does not suffice in this regard]
2. Avoid vague statements like $\tau \to \infty$ in the introduction regarding the work of Jin et al. and state precisely their contributions in this context. In the current version of the paper, a version of this is done in page 4, but the introduction is painting a different picture, so this discussion should be transferred there.
3. A persisting concern is that the authors' characterization of $\tau^*$ cannot inform a practical choice of step-size scaling (because the value of $\tau^*$ derived by the authors depends on quantities that cannot be known to the optimizer). Neither the reviewers nor myself were particularly convinced by the authors' reply on this point. However, this can also be seen as an "equilibrium refinement" result, i.e., for a given value of $\tau$ only certain equilibria can be stable. I believe this can be of interest to the community, even though the authors' characterization cannot directly inform the choice of $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ (or their ratio).

Modulo the above remarks (which the authors should incorporate in their paper), I am recommending acceptance.

The paper studies over-parametrized neural networks when the size of the network goes to infinity. It is known that training the network via gradient descent type algorithms is equivalent to learning via the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) The paper is well-written and the results make non-trivial extensions over the state-of-the-art. The exposition of the concepts is very good in general, though some references and some (minor) aspects appear to be missing.
Gold Metareview 266:
The paper provides a uniform generalization bound for overparameterized neural networks using the notion of maximal information gain. The analysis relies on the eigendecay of the eigenvalues of the NTK, which has recently been the object of a lot of work in the literature, including the work of Bietti and Bach (the proof actually uses one of their key lemma).

The paper originally received a set of reviews with a large disagreement between the reviewers (including two reviewers with a negative opinion and three reviewers being more positive). After the discussion period, two reviewers kept a very negative opinion, while other reviewers slightly lowered their score. Some of the problems raised by the reviewers include the restrictions imposed on the data, a missing proof (which was eventually added by the authors), the discussion of prior work being inadequate (including for instance the differences with more classical generalization bounds), and the novelty of the analysis.

Overall, the paper clearly has some merits but some of the concerns above are too important at this stage to accept the paper. I recommend the authors address the concerns mentioned in the reviews before re-submission.

Experiments on several datasets show improved performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. The paper is presented well, and it's a good read. My major concern is on the novelty of the proposed method. How would the VIB framework work with a different PLM, e.g., XLM-Roberta or T5?

The paper shows the success of a relatively simple idea -- fine tune a pretrained BERT Model using Variational Information Bottleneck method of Alemi to improve transfer learning in low resource scenarios.

I agree with the reviewers that novelty is low -- one would like to use any applicable method for controlling overfitting when doing transfer learning, and of the suite of good candidates, VIB is an obvious one -- but at the same time, I'm moved by the results because of: the improvements and the success on a wide range of tasks and the surprising success of VIB over other alternatives like dropout etc, and hence I'm breaking the tie in the reviews by supporting acceptance.  Its a nice trick that the community could use, if the results of the paper are an indication of its potential.

This paper addresses the interesting and challenging problem of learning the reward function from demonstrators which have unknown biases. The main shortcomings of the paper are a lack of clarity at certain points and a limited experimental validation. The proposed approach can work effectively in larger scale domains with more difficult biases. It begs the question whether accounting for unknown systematic bias can indeed outperform the assumption of a particular inaccurate bias. It would be good if the authors could at least mention that “Boltzmann rational’ is a specific model of “systematic” bias for which much experimental support eith humans and animals exists.

The authors study an inverse reinforcement learning problem where the goal is to infer an underlying reward function from demonstration with bias.  To achieve this, the authors learn the planners and the reward functions from demonstrations. As this is in general impossible, the authors consider two special cases in which either the reward function is observed on a subset of tasks or in which the observations are assumed to be close to optimal. They propose algorithms for both cases and evaluate these in basic experiments. The problem considered is important and challenging. One issue is that in order to make progress the authors need to make strong and restrictive assumptions (e.g., assumption 3, the well-suited inductive bias). It is not clear if the assumptions made are reasonable. Experimentally, it would be important to see how results change if the model for the planner changes and to evaluate what the inferred biases would be. Overall, there is consensus among the reviewers that the paper is interesting but not ready for publication.

This paper proposes a distribution shift benchmark for unsupervised anomaly detection. The dataset is built over a network traffic data Kyoto-2006+ and the test data is split into three distributions IID, NEAR, and FAR chronologically. Some preliminary experiments also show the performance degradation of classic anomaly detection algorithms due to the data distribution shift. The proposed problem is practical and meaningful. The authors provide a long-time data created by using honeypots to detect anomalous traffic.

Four out of five reviewers recommend acceptance of the paper with a score of 7. These reviewers praise the quality and importance of the dataset. Moreover, all reviewers acknowledge the quality of the writing.

The authors have constructively engaged into the discussion with the reviewers, and have put a lot of effort into drastically improving their submission based on all reviewers' comments. The weaknesses raised by the reviewers have been successfully addressed.

In particular, the reviewer (dm8f) who gave a score of 4 raised the following concerns:

1. There exist other time series anomaly detection datasets.
2. More anomaly detection methods should be considered in the experiments. 
3. The finetune mode and distillation mode are not detailed, their pseudocodes should be provided.

The authors have addressed these concerns as follows:

1. In their answer, the authors went through an extensive list of existing benchmarks and justified why they are not appropriate to solve their focused problem, and how their dataset differ from those. The main added value of the proposed dataset is its timespan and the fact that its occurring distribution shifts are natural (as opposed to synthesized).
2. The authors have expanded their experiments with more anomaly detection models. The new results corroborate the previous conclusions.
3. The authors have added the pseudocode algorithm in Appendix and have added code to replicate their experiments in the git repository.

I believe that the authors have sufficiently addressed the reviewer's concerns (and more).

For these reasons, I recommend acceptance of the paper.

The paper describes an adversarial training approach that, in addition to the commonly used robustness loss, requires the network to extract similar representation distributions for clean and attacked data. The main idea is to treat the problem as a domain adaptation problem by considering the data shift between adversarial and clean distributions. Authors claim that the proposed method outperforms other methods when the target domain is the adversarial examples. The experiment section is not comprehensive. More recent SOTA methods are missing. The authors show that their proposed method provides: 1) higher accuracy on attacked data (more robustness), and 2) higher Accuracy on clean data.

Gold Metareview 271:
The paper describes an adversarial training approach that, in addition to the commonly used robustness loss, requires the network to extract similar representation distributions for clean and attacked data. The proposed method is inspired by domain adaptation approaches that require a model to extract domain invariant/agnostic features from two domains. Although the experimental results are solid and technically sound, the novelty of the methodology is not enough, as the domain classifier and the gradient reversal layer are the same with those methods in domain adaptation such as "unsupervised domain adaptation by backpropagation". On the other hand, more recent SOTA methods are missing and only smaller scale datasets are used for evaluation. During the discussions, the major concerns from three reviewers are novelty. 

I totally agree that the simplicity of the method should be a virtue. However, the idea of domain-invariant representation learning is already established well, and its application to adversarial training is quite intuitive to the community. Also, the similar methodology already exists in domain adaptation. According to the top-tier conference culture in the ML community, what most valuable is the novelty and insight, not the performance. In the end, I think that this paper may not be ready for publication at ICLR, but the next version must be a strong paper.

Gold Metareview 272:
The paper proposes a new pipeline-parallel training method called WPipe. WPipe works (on a very high level) by replacing the two-buffer structure of PipeDream-2BW with a two-partition-group structure, allowing resources to be shared in a similar way to PipeDream-2BW but with less memory use and less delays in weight update propagation across stages. The 1.4x speedup it achieves over PipeDream-2BW is impressive.

In discussion, the reviewers agreed that the problem WPipe tries to tackle is important and that the approach is novel and interesting. But there was significant disagreement among the reviewers as to score. A reviewer expressed concern about the work being incremental and difficult to follow. And while these were valid concerns, and the authors should take note of them when revising their paper, I do not think they should present a bar to publication, both based on my own read of the work and also in light of the fact that other reviewers with higher confidence scores did not find novelty to be a disqualifying concern. As a result, I plan to follow the majority reviewer opinion and recommend acceptance here.

Then, the paper proposes a multi-pronged approach to evaluate the robustness of healthcare ML models. The overall idea is well-motivated and addresses a unique and important challenge in ML for health. The paper is quite clear, but could do with some additional figures showing correlations between in-the-wild performance and the proposed measures. The highlights in Table 2 is misleading - when several numbers are equal, they should all be highlighted.

Gold Metareview 273:
The paper introduces model-agnostic ways of quantifying predictive uncertainty and latent space differences in the situation when the distribution of data encountered during deployment differs from what the system was trained on and there is no access to the data itself. The model is evaluated on large scale EEG data.

The paper solves an important problem, in particular to the field of healthcare which has previously seen instances of models underperforming significantly at the time of deployment. As mentioned by the reviewers, this direction has not been sufficiently explored, so there is novelty in the problem itself, as well as in the solution. The experiments on EEG data were seen as convincing by the reviewers, though some questions were raised about the scope of the paper.

Overall, there is considerable merit in the work and recommend acceptance of this paper. In the camera ready, the authors should make sure not to overstate the applicability of their method. While this work could, in theory, be applied (or adapted) to other data, the merits of it outside of models trained on EEG data have not been demonstrated and should therefore not be stated as a given.

Reviewers x119 and PL6S have not engaged in the discussion although the authors responded to the issues they raised, which I kept in mind when issuing my recommendation.

This manuscript proposes and analyses a bucketing method for Byzantine-robustness in non-iid federated learning. The manuscript shows how existing Byzantine-robust methods suffer vulnerabilities when the devices are non-iid, and describe a simple coordinated attack that defeats many existing defenses. In response, the primary algorithmic contribution is a bucketing approach that aggregates subgroups of devices before robust aggregation. This approach is also easily composed with existing Byzantine-robust methods. The manuscript includes an analysis of the performance of the proposed approach, including an information-theoretic lower bound for certain settings.

The paper considers model-based RL, and focuses on approaches that benefit from the differentiability of the model in order to compute the policy gradient. It theoretically shows that the error in the gradient of the model w.r.t. its input appears in an upper bound of the error in the policy gradient computing using the learned model. Motivated by this, it suggests a MBRL approach that learns two models, one of them minimizes the next-state prediction error (as commonly done) and the other minimizes a combination of prediction error and the gradient error. 
The paper empirically studies the method through extensive experiments.

Reviewers are generally positive about this work. They believe that the paper is insightful and the method is original. At first, there were some important concerns raised by the reviewers, but the authors revised their paper in the discussion period, and it appears that the reviewers are all satisfied now. I also read the paper during the rebuttal phase, and I should say that I have some concerns myself, especially on the theory part of the paper. Given that the authors did not have an opportunity to answer my questions, I do not put much weight on my concerns (and I believe most of them can be addressed with some clarifications). Considering the positive response of reviewers and promising results, I am going to recommend **acceptance** of this paper.

I strongly encourage the authors to consider the comments by reviewers, as well as the following ones, in the revision of their paper.


**Comments**

1) The true dynamics $f$ is defined as a stochastic one, i.e., $s_{t+1} = f(s_t, a_t, \epsilon_t)$ (just before Eq. 1), and similarly for the learned model. Here $\epsilon_t$ is the noise causing the stochasticity of the model. But later, when the errors on the model and its gradient are introduced (i.e., $\epsilon_f$ and $\epsilon_f^g$), the role of stochasticity becomes unclear.
For example, we have
$\|| \tilde{f}(s,a) - f(s,a) \||  \leq \epsilon_f$.

What happened to the noise term?

The same is true for Eq. (5). The next-state s' (either according to the true dynamics or the learned model) is random. In that case, it is not obvious how to interpret Eq. (5). Is it the error of the expected gradient of the next state? Or is it something else?

In case the dynamics is assumed to be deterministic, this should be clarified early in the paper.

2) The upper bound in Theorem 1 might be vacuous if the Lipschitz constant $L_f$ of the model is larger than 1.
To see this, consider Lemma 1. The constant $C_0$ is $\min [D/\epsilon_f, (1-L_f^{t+1})/(1 - L_f)]$.
If $L_f$ is larger than 1, for large enough t, the term $(1-L_f^{t+1})/(1 - L_f)$ blows up and $C_0$ becomes $D/\epsilon_f$. Therefore, the upper bound of Lemma 1 becomes $D$. Here $D$ is the diameter of the state space, which is assumed to be bounded.

This carries to in the next lemmas. In Lemma 4, $C_5$ would be of the same order as $C_0$ (multiplied by an extra $L_1 L_f / (1 - \gamma) )$, so the upper bound of this lemma becomes proportional to D too.

The $C_0$'s appearance continues in the proof of Theorem 1, in which $C_8$ is proportional to $C_0$ and $C_5$. So, $C_8$ is also become proportional to $D/\epsilon_f$. When we have $C_8 \epsilon_f$ in Eq. (34), we get a constant term $D$.
A similar dependence appears in the proof of Theorem 2, where B_3 is proportional to $C_8 \epsilon_f$, which can be as large as $D$. And in Eq. (47), we have $B_3^2$. So the upper bound in Eq. (47), which seems to the be upper bound of Theorem 2, is proportional to $D^2$. This means that if $L_f$ is larger than one, the upper bound does not go to zero, no matter how small the model error $\epsilon_f$ is (unless it is actually zero). This makes the bound meaningless.

This might be unavoidable. I am not sure about it at the moment. But it definitely requires a discussion.

3) Assumption 2 has a term in the form of $E[\frac{s_{t_2}}{ s_{t_1}} ]$ (I have simplified the form). The states $s_{t_2}$ and $s_{t_1}$ are vectors in general. How is the division defined here?

4) Please improve the clarify of the proofs. For example, in Lemma 2 it seems that a negative sign is missing in Eq. (49). Also how do we get Eq. (50) and Eq. (52)? (I couldn't easily verify them).

5) I believe the "periodicity property" used in Assumption 1 should be "ergodicity property".

6) The paper still has a lot of typos, e.g., "To optimize the objective, One can ..." (P3), "argument data" (instead of augmented) (p4), "Superpose" (p5), "funcrion" (p6).

This paper proposes an algorithm for training sequence-to-sequence models from scratch to optimize edit distance. The algorithm, called optimal completion distillation (OCD), avoids the exposure bias problem inherent in maximum likelihood estimation training, is efficient and easily implemented, and does not have any tunable hyperparameters. Experiments on Librispeech and Wall Street Journal show that OCD improves test performance over both maximum likelihood and scheduled sampling, yielding state-of-the-art results. The primary concerns expressed by the reviewers pertained to the relationship of OCD to methods such as SEARN, DAgger, AggreVaTe, LOLS, and several other papers. The revision addresses the problem with a substantially larger number of references and discussion relating OCD to the previous work. Some issues of clarity were also well addressed by the revision.

The authors propose an algorithm for enhancing noisy speech by also accounting for the phase information. This is done by adapting UNets to handle features defined in the complex space, and by adapting the loss function to improve an appropriate evaluation metric.

Strengths
- Modifies existing techniques well to better suit the domain for which the algorithm is being proposed. Modifications like extending UNet to complex Unet to deal with phase, redefining the mask and loss are all interesting improvements.
- Extensive results and analysis.

Weaknesses
- The work is centered around speech enhancement, and hence has limited focus. 

Even though the paper is limited to speech enhancement, the reviewers agreed that the contributions made by the paper are significant and can help improve related applications like ASR. The paper is well written with interesting results and analysis. Therefore, it is recommended that the paper be accepted.

This paper builds on a promising line of literature developing connections between Gaussian processes and deep neural networks.  Viewing one model under the lens of (the infinite limit of) another can lead to neat new insights and algorithms.  In this case the authors develop a connection between convolutional networks and Gaussian processes with a particular kind of kernel.  The reviews were quite mixed with one champion and two just below borderline.

The reviewers all believed the paper had contributions which would be interesting to the community (such as R1: "the paper presents a novel efficient way to compute the convolutional kernel, which I believe has merits on its own" and R2: "I really like the idea of authors that kernels based on convolutional networks might be more practical compared to the ones based on fully connected networks").  All the reviewers found the contribution of the covariance function to be novel and exciting.

Some cited weaknesses of the paper were that the authors didn't analyze the uncertainty from the model (arguably the reasoning for adopting a Bayesian treatment), novelty in appealing to the central limit theorem to arrive at the connection, and scalability of the model.

In the review process it also became apparent that there was another paper with a substantially similar contribution.  The decision for this paper was calibrated accordingly with that work.

Weighing the strengths and weaknesses of the paper and taking into account a reviewer willing to champion the work it seems there is enough novel contribution and interest in the work to justify acceptance.

The authors provided responses to the reviewer concerns including calibration plots and timing experiments in the discussion period and it would be appreciated if these can be incorporated into the camera ready version.

DaSGD is an algorithm for large-scale large-batch training of deep neural networks. The algorithm combines Local SGD with delayed averaging steps to hide the communication overhead. Authors decided to decrease the font size of all important equations and plots to fit the conference size requirements. The paper is well-written and easy to understand. I have some concerns in the novelty. I did not find the improvement regarding the wall clock time by hiding the communication in the experiment.

This paper proposes a variant of stochastic gradient descent that parallelizes the algorithm for distributed training via delayed gradient averaging. While the algorithm (DaSGD) proposed is sensible and seems to work, it also seems to miss a lot of related work. As pointed out by one of the reviewers, the class of asynchronous decentralized methods already seem to cover the space of DaSGD, and it's not clear how DaSGD differs from the existing methods in this space. As a result of this lack of comparison to related work, the reviewers recommended that the paper not be accepted at this time, and this evaluation was not challenged by an author response. I agree with this consensus.

The paper studies decentralized optimization algorithm over general communication weight matrix. The weight matrix has to be fixed over time, so it does not seem to apply to decentralized algorithms where the communication pattern is different in different steps. When the matrix is fixed, the paper proves the optimal convergence rate for nonconvex objectives. The main innovation is the new structure of the connection graph, which can be used to revisiting the lower bounds. The article is quite well written and easy to follow.

This paper presents some new results on near-optimum algorithms for distributed optimization, nearly matching lower bounds. Most of the reviewers are positive about the contributions of this work. However, one issue that came up is the assumption of bounded gradient dissimilarity, which is essentially a gap between upper and lower bounds. While I am recommending to accept this paper, I believe this gap should be more prominently discussed in the abstract and introduction.

This paper tackles the problem of controlled text generation by converting it into a conditional text generation similar to (Keskar et al.19). It proposes an architectural modification to the transformer LM used in GPT2. A CoCon layer is added as a separate transformer block in the middle allowing self-attention to be performed. The novelty of the CoCon method lies in its ability to condition on entire input sequences. The paper is well written, the method is intuitive and all components are well motivated.

The paper aims at controllable generation by introducing an additional "content-conditioner" block in the Transformer models. The paper further provides 4 different variants of a pre-training task to train the content-conditioner model. 

While the proposed approach seems an incremental contribution over CTRL and PPLM, certain reviews praised the approach being novel while keeping the architecture changes minimal. Overall, reviews indicate that the overall proposed method of fine-grained controlled generation with self-supervision is valuable, and empirical results support its effectiveness. 

All reviewers initially raised concerns regarding clarity and lack of human evaluation. However, clarity issues seem to be resolved through author/reviewer discussions and the updated revision.

R3 had important concerns regarding topic and sentiment relevance evaluations.  
While the reviewer remains unconvinced after discussions with authors, after carefully reading the revised paper and discussions, I feel that the authors tried to address this point fairly  through their additional experiments and also edited their contribution statement accordingly.

Overall, at least two reviewers sounded very excited about this work and other than R3's concerns, the general sentiment about this work was positive. Therefore, I recommend weak accept.  

There are still some writing issues that I strongly encourage authors to carefully address in the future versions. Quoting from reviewer discussions:

> Differentiability of the adversarial loss. Authors just added one statement saying " Through continuous approximation.." without any more details are given, which continuous approx was used (Gumbel softmax?) and how they overcame the problem of its training instability. 

> Table 6, can be misleading, authors bold the results when cocon+ is performing better than baselines (mostly in content similarity) but not the other way around topic/sentiment accuracy. The latter is arguably more important.

The paper proposes constructing a pyramid-shaped input representation based on a pyramid attention mechanism. The pyramid attention combines three levels of looking at the source code (statement, token, and subtoken level) The levels are combined bottom up from subtoken to statement level, and also with a cross-granularity interaction. The proposed method is elegant, does not overcomplicate the process, and seems easily reproducible. Authors do not provide limitation section nor analyze the results qualitatively.

Gold Metareview 291:
The paper presents a multi-granularity input represenaion and a pyramid attention mechanism for code summarizaiton tasks. After extensive discussion, the reviewers still cannot agree on accepting or rejecting this paper. The key discussion points and my opinion are summarized in below. 


1. Performance improvement -- a few reviewers point out the performance improvement is relatively small (about 1%) compared with baseline. With the additional error bar provided by the authors, it seems to me the improvement is statistically significant. The authors also provide sufficient ablation study to justify the improvement. Although it's arguable if the proposed appracoh is substantial, the progress of AI is often driven by incremental improvement in terms of performance. Therefore, I'm less concerned by this issue. 

2. Comparison only on 1 language and 2 datasets. I partially agree with the authors and reviwers Xtyo that the paper already conducted extensive experiments and the merits of the proposed approach are justified. However, I disagree with the attritue that the comparison on 1 language is sufficient given the recent progress of code summariziton. As the proposed approach is mainly justified by empirical comparison, conducting results on a limited dataset raises the concern whether the proposed approach is generalizble to other languages and datasets. It also makes future work harder to compare with this work. I especially disagree the point that some earlier papers only compared on limited datasets. These papers are published earlier than the benchmark CodeXGlue has been released. As most recent baselines are compared on CodeXGlue, there is a need to justify the missing of results on this dataset. Besides, the argument of the dataet is noisy the performance is low do not seem rigorous and reasonable to me.

3. Human evaluation. The authors provide a preliminary study of human evaluation on the generated outputs. On one hand, it shows the proposed approach indeed improve the quality of the summary, but on the other hand, the study requires more rigorous design. I would suggest including the human evaluation on the main text rather than in appendix. 

4. Presentation. The paper is mostly well-written and provide nice intuition behind the propose method. However, I also agree with Q2Zz that some statements might overclaim and require justification. The later part of the paper has significant number of typos and require a careful proofread. It's pity that the authors do not take the opportunity during the rebuttal period to revise the paper.

Overall, I think the paper has sufficient merits but still have room to improve.

This paper incorporates a concept called hypergraph network into reinforcement learning. The idea of hypergraph is to extend edge to hyperedge where a set of vertices can be considered at the same time. Empirical results on a few atari games (29) and simulated physical control benchmarks clearly demonstrate the superiority of the approach. The paper is clearly written and well-organized. But in general, I find the technical contributions (borderline) to be incremental.

After reading the reviews and rebuttal and looking over the paper, I feel that the results are indeed strong, and the paper could have an impact in terms of exploiting the relationship among action dimensions. Maybe the only detail that I would add is that going through the example given in Fig 1 completely could be useful as it might not be perfectly obvious how (e.g. considering a simple mixing function like summation) one retrieves the q values for someone not familiar with this particular topic.

The authors use a deep-learning pipeline to understand the nature of encoding in the salamander retina. They collect PSTHs from neurons in response to short natural movies, then the PSTHS are converted to images and used as the input to a U-Net. Curiously, the latent representation can be used to accurately decode time in the movie, even for completely novel movies. This suggests that the model learns a low-dimensional representation of elapsed time.

Gold Metareview 293:
The authors analyze the latent representation of visual features from natural movies in the salamander retina using a U-net. They train an encoder to learn a compressed latent representation from a large population of salamander retinal ganglion cells responding to natural movies, while a decoder samples from this compressed latent space to generate the appropriate movie frame. They characterize its representation of “time in the natural scene” in the latent space of their model.

Overall, the reviewers expressed a lot of interest in the topic and valued the novel application to salamander retinal data. There were some questions about the significance of the finding, and through the rebuttal period, the authors provided a number of experiments to compare against other variants of their baselines (and ablations), with some reviewers increasing their scores in favor of acceptance. 

At the same time, there was concern that the U-Net architecture could potentially reconstruct the movie without any retinal data. Thus, it was not entirely clear whether the model was truly leveraging the retinal data to obtain meaningful outputs. Unfortunately, this concern was not fully addressed in the revision, leaving the reviewers overall with mixed views but the majority in favor of acceptance.

Lack of explanation on how this novel method can be applied in real-world scenarios. Good references to other research overall, but references missing at times. More explanation on prior methods, who derived them, what applications they have nowadays, and where they are being used in the AI world. The paper is not easy to follow, which makes it hard to pinpoint the exact contribution. The proposed approach is an interesting contribution to network Granger causal modelling.

The paper is concerned with selective classification in a stylised 'realisably noisy' data model. It is approached by designing a new loss for learning a selector given a predictor $f$, denoted $W(g;f, \theta) The proposed method has remarkably better selective risk compared to the underlying classification literature. The problem of identifying uninformative data is interesting and very relevant in modern machine learning. The theory of the paper---though highly stylized and based on $0-1$ loss that cannot be optimized efficiently---is revealing and also a good starting point.

Learning theory is provided for this setting and a novel algorithm is devised that identifies predictable examples and makes predictions at the same time.

Overall they found this work interesting and relevant to ML community and appreciate the effort that authors have put in in their thoughtful response. However, after a thorough deliberation conference program committee decided that the paper is not sufficiently strong in its current form to be accepted.

Different pairwise relations based on ASTs and sequence ordering are computed and each of them is encoded as a separate distance matrix.

By adding positional relational information, such as shortest path length, and ancestor distance the transformers learn to better represent code.

The paper gives an extension of the transformer model that is suited to computing representations of source code. The main difference from transformers is that the model takes in a program's abstract syntax tree (AST) in addition to its sequence representation, and utilizes several pairwise distance measures between AST nodes in the self-attention operation. The model is evaluated on the task of code summarization for 5 different languages and shown to beat two state-of-the-art models. One interesting observation is that a model trained on data from all languages outperforms the monolingual version of the model.

The reviewers generally liked the paper. The technical idea is simple, but the evaluation is substantial and makes a convincing case about setting a new state of the art. The observation about multilingual models is also interesting. While there were a few concerns, many of these were addressed in the authors' responses, and the ones that remain seem minor. Given this, I am recommending acceptance as a poster. Please incorporate the reviewers' comments in the final version.

The manuscript proves a new (finite-sample) generalization bound for generalized linear models, using Moreau envelope theory. The paper also provides experimental validation.

While the results only hold for Gaussian data, I believe there is some interesting novel results which might inspire some future work in the learning theory community. (In comparison, several novel frameworks have been created in the past for other problems, in which the initial versions assumed Gaussianity, e.g., the work on support recovery on sparse linear regression, for instance.)

Several technical clarifications regarding the assumptions (e.g., surrogate distribution, comparison to prior results) were asked by the reviewers, which the authors thoroughly and successfully addressed during the rebuttal phase. I recommend adding this to the camera-ready version of the paper, as well as other discussions and clarifications raised by all the reviewers.

In this paper, the authors tackle the problem of demonstrators and learners having different observation spaces, by proposing an importance-weighted learning algorithm to bring the support of the imitator state marginal closer to that of the expert demonstrator's state marginal. 

All reviewers have voted to weak accept, but it would seem that this year's NeurIPS mechanism of reviewer assignment has resulted in a much higher acceptance rate than typical, with 80%+ of the AC batch having accept votes. As such, I am tasked with the tough job of rejecting some papers that reviewers were only lukewarmly excited about. It pains me to do this to a paper that reviewers have found methodologically correct. I will be recommending this paper be rejected based on calibration against other papers I'm AC'ing, mostly for the following reason:

The HOIL paper assumes a problem setting where:

1. expert observations with more privilege observations than learner: 
2. access to expert observations being high cost and invasive 
3. importance-weighting the data to close the support between learner and expert state distributions mitigates (1) and (2)

However, it's not demonstrated that (1) and (2) is an actual problem in practical applications. Is sensor mismatch between human and autonomous vehicles the actual problem for learning? Do self-driving cars even utilize a policy formulation explored in the HOIL paper? How big are these state / support mismatches in practice, and couldn't they be mitigated by simpler methods? This paper is the first I've heard suggested that sensor mismatch between humans and autonomous vehicle sensors is the bottleneck for performance. If we remove this motivation from the paper and only consider the importance weighting algorithm used for removing out of distribution examples, then it doesn't feel quite as novel as there are many works that propose some kind of distribution-projection step as a way to mitigate state marginal differences between teachers and learners (e.g. CQL). 

In fact, the setting (1) is not only avoided, but actively exploited by some learning papers (Asymmetric Actor Critic, Guided Policy Search, and other ideas) to *boost* the sample efficiency of learning, with the idea that the asymmetry in state support allows experts to provide useful learning signal in a way that the learner cannot adversarially overfit easily. 

From reviewer pD56, 
```
I didn't find the authors' response to be particularly convincing (the self-driving example doesn't seem like a good fit for what they're doing, and I think they're conflating differences in perceptual accuracy with differences in sensing hardware).

This paper may seem acceptable on the basis of its scores, but R1 (in particular) and R3 did a shambolic job of reviewing: their reviews are extremely short, and offer no substance to justify their scores. R2 has admirably engaged in discussion and upped their score to 6, but continue to find the paper fairly borderline, as do I. Weighing the reviews by the confidence I have in the reviewers based on their engagement, I would have to concur with R2 that this paper is very borderline. I like the core idea, but agree that the presentation of the inference techniques for V-NMN is complex and its presentation could stand to be significantly improved. I appreciate that the authors have made some updates on the basis of R2's feedback, but unfortunately due to the competitive nature of this year's ICLR and the number of acceptable paper, I cannot fully recommend acceptance at this time.

However, the paper seems to be incomplete and needs to be further improved.

## Description
The paper discovers interesting phenomena in training neural networks with binary weights:
- Connection between latent weight magnitude and how important its binarized version for the network performance
-training dynamics, indicating that large latent weights are identified and stabilize early on
- Observation that amongst learned binary kernel, several specific patterns prevail, up to the bits who's reversal has very little effect. This is so regardless of the architecture, the layer considered or the dataset. 
The paper further demonstrates how these observations may be used to compress binary neural networks below 1 bit per weight.

## Review Process and Decision
The reviewers welcomed the experimental investigation of new phenomena, but commented the overall technical quality of the work as somewhat substandard. The redundancy of consecutive affine transforms is known and not connected to binary weights investigation. The investigation itself lacks a more in-depth analysis. The proposed compression results appeared not convincing to reviewers since a significant drop of accuracy occurs. The AC shares these concerns and supports rejection.

## General Comments
From my perspective, the study undertaken is methodologically „wrong“. An ad-hoc training method is investigated, which is not even clearly defined in the paper (there are many „STE“ variants) and for which it is not known what it is doing, what are the real-valued weights for and whether they are needed at all (as empirically argued by Helwegen et al. (2019)). As such, the investigation makes impression of poking a black box (the training method in this case). At the same time, there are more clear learning formulations, applicable in the setting of the paper (binary weights), in particular considering the stochastic relaxation:
* Shayer et al. (2017): Learning Discrete Weights Using the Local Reparameterization Trick
* Roth et al. (2019): Training Discrete-Valued Neural Networks with Sign Activations Using Weight Distributions
* Peters et al. (2018): Probabilistic binary neural networks

These methods are approximate, but at least the optimization is well posed and it is known what do the real-valued weights represent (e.g. logits of binary weight probabilities).
From this perspective, it can be seen that latent weights close to 0 correspond to Bernoulli weights that are almost fully random (and thus only contribute noise) and are fragile to gradient steps. Therefore the model can only perform well if it learns to be robust to their state or their state becomes more deterministic (corresponding to large latent weight). So one would actually expect to see in these models phenomena similar to the observed in the paper and not bee too much surprised or astonished by them. Furthermore, there are recent works explaining STE and its latent weights as optimizing the stochastic relaxation:
* Meng et al. (2020): Training Binary Neural Networks using the Bayesian Learning Rule
* Yanush et al. (2020): Reintroducing Straight-Through Estimators as Principled Methods for Stochastic Binary Networks. 

The authors are encouraged to make the observed phenomena more explainable by connecting to the mentioned works.

## Further Details

*  „We show that in the context of using batch normalization after convolutional layers, adapting scaling factors with either hand-crafted or learnable methods brings marginal or no accuracy gain to final model.“

From theoretical perspective, this is obvious and known to me. Practically, there could be in principle some difference due to the learning dynamics, and verifying that there is none is a useful but a weak contribution. The section devoted to this issue can be given in the appendix but is not justified in the main paper.

* „change of weight signs is crucial in the training of BWNs“

The sign determines the binary weights, so this is by definition.

* „ Firstly, the training of BWNs demonstrates the process of seeking primary binary sub-networks whose weight signs are determined and fixed at the early training stage, which is akin to recent findings on the lottery ticket hypothesis for efficient learning of sparse neural networks“

In the lottery ticket hypothesis paper it is shown explicitly that the identified sparse subnetwork changes during the learning the most rather than retains its initialization state or the state in the beginning of the training. It is therefore could be of a different nature.

The paper presents several interesting insights about the behavior of adversarial training algorithms. The proposed methods are shown to out-perform PGD-AT and TRADES. They also discover that robust overfitting can occur with memorization and use temporal ensembling to mitigate it. However, the findings in the paper are disconnected and some of them lack explanations. The authors propose a mitigation algorithm by a regularization term for avoiding the excessive memorization.

Gold Metareview 306:
This paper demonstrates that deep networks can memorize adversarial examples of training data with completely random labels, which motivates some analyses on the convergence and generalization of adversarial training (AT). The authors identify a significant drawback of memorization in AT that could result in robust overfitting and propose a new algorithm to mitigate this drawback. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. One of the reviewers is concerned about (1) the validity of stability analysis where 80% of the data labels are noisy, and the perturbation (64/255) is large, (2) the gap between theory and practice, and (3) novelty. The authors have made a great effort to address these concerns. Although there is still no consensus after the author's response, the majority of the reviewers are in strong support. I, therefore, recommend acceptance.

The HRL method uses a 2 level hierarchy for sparse reward tasks. The low level policies are only provided access to proprioceptive parts of the observation. The higher level policy is trained as usual by commanding lower level policies. Overall the writing is good... but I did find the main statement of the algorithm confusing! I think this deserves a proper appendix with everything spelled out. This paper presents an approach for hierarchical RL based on an ensemble of low-level controllers.

Gold Metareview 308:
Strengths 

The paper presents a method of training two-level hierarchies that is based on relatively intuitive ideas and that performs well.
The challenges of hierarchical RL makes this an important problem. The benefits of periodicity and the
separation of internal state from external state is a clean principle that can potentially be broadly employed. 
The method does well in outperforming the alternative baselines.

Weaknesses

There is no video of the results. There is related work, i.e., [Peng et al. 2016] (rev 4) uses 
a policy ensemble;  phase info is used in DeepLoco/DeepMimic; methods such as "Virtual Windup Toys for Animation" 
exploited periodicity (25y ago);  More comparisons with prior work such as Florensa et al. would help. 
The separation of internal and external state is an assumption that may not hold in many cases.
The results are locomotion focussed. There are only two timescales.

Decision

The reviewers are largely in agreement to accept the paper. 
There are fairly-simple-but-useful lessons to be found in the paper
for those working on HRL problems, particularly those for movement and locomotion. 
The AC sees the novely with respect to different pieces of related work is the weakest point of the paper.  
The reviews contain good suggestions for revisions and improvements;  the latest version may take care
of these (uploaded after the last reviewer comments). Overall, the paper will make a good contribution
to ICLR 2019.

This paper proposes a differentiable meta-solver applicable to large-scale combinatorial optimization. After a thorough discussion phase, all the reviewers are on the positive side of this paper. The reviewers appreciated the novelty of this paper and the importance of scaling neural combinatorial optimization for large-scale instances. Overall, I recommend acceptance for this paper.

However, the reviewers also showed concerns about the presentation of this paper. The gap between generalization and testing performance is not clearly discussed and the connection to prior works using continuous latent space should be clearly stated. Since scalability is an important issue, it would be useful to clear up time/objective comparison and unify experimental settings as suggested by Reviewer fQdp and fe3B.

This paper proposes improving human interpretability and manipulability of neural representations by obtaining syntactic roles (here, subject, object, prepositional object, and main verb) without supervision by means of them becoming linked to latent variables in a novel proposed attention-driven VAE (ADVAE) model, which provides cross attention between a language transformer and latent variables. The paper argues that syntactic roles are quite central to meaning interpretation and that the ADVAE recovers them better than LSTM or Transformer (with mean pooling) VAEs.

This is a quite interesting direction and paper. There was active discussion with the reviewers, one of whom (9pDc) moved their rating from reject to quite strong support, while the other reviewers either sat on the fence or raised from reject to borderline. Nevertheless, I overall tend to agree that the paper is still lacking in empirical support, a view clearly shared by reviewers WuPD and 7uFL. The SNLI data is very simple descriptive sentences, nearly all in the form of S V O or S V PP. Would this work on more complex data, in other languages, or with more word order variation? There isn't very much investigation, but the new results added during reviewing based on Yelp data seem to offer more concerns than confidence. These are also very short sentences but with more varied structure and some complementation. It seems like D_{dec} is now very low (much lower than for the sequence VAE), the ability to distinguish out grammatical roles seems limited to {subj} vs. {dobj, pobj} in the encoder and none at all in the decoder (Figure 6/7). And then for the examples in Appendix D, the disentanglement abilities barely seem stronger than being able to pick out subjects, though when there are sentences with subordinate clauses, it is perhaps random which subject you get. The resampled realizations in appendix H also seem to show limited disentanglement: resampling the subject usually seems to change the object as well, often markedly. No convincing downstream applications are shown. As such, while I agree that disentanglement is at the heart of representation learning, I can't get on board with reviewer 9pDc feeling that this paper now has convincing results. Reviewer 7uFL also emphasizes that there is no strong reason that the latent variables have to align with syntactic roles. In particular, the motivation in NMT whereby constituents clump and reorder together does not exist here. It may only work for the very simple and regular sentences of SNLI.

Hence, overall, I feel that this method needs more extensive validation on harder, more varied data sets before it becomes a convincing contribution, and so I propose rejecting the paper at this point in time. Nevertheless, I do think the topic is interesting and this approach has the potential to be good.

This paper introduces a prompting technique for eliciting factual knowledge from frozen pretained transformer LMs. The key idea is to modify the embeddings produced by the embedding layer before they are passed to the first attention layer and the paper investigates several different design choices. The Reviewers all agree that the paper tackles an important problem with interesting methods, that it is well written and has strong results. The main concerns, raised by Reviewer jddf, were about clarifying the connections to the robust optimization literature and evaluating on OOD relations. The former has been addressed in the revised version. While the latter point remains valid, I find that the paper in its current state has enough useful experiments and analysis to warrant publication. The authors have clarified most of the other points raised by the reviewers in their rebuttal.

The paper studies the behavior cloning based strategies of offline RL algorithms in different type of environments and reports that performance primarily depends on model size and regularization. The results contradict some of the earlier claims, and the authors conjecture that model size and regularization characteristics can explain past results.  

During the review period, the reviewers agreed that the paper has certain merits, and on the other hand, they also raised some concerns, regarding some missing technical details, whether the empirical finding could be trusted, the generalization of the findings to more scenarios, and the comparison with some highly related papers. The authors did a good job in their rebuttal, which removed many of the above concerns (although not all) and convinced the reviewers to raise their scores. As a result, we believe it is fine to accept the paper (although somehow like a weak accept).

This paper considers the problem of online reinforcement learning in two-player zero-sum Markov games. They consider a class of Markov games called kernel mixture Markov games, which extend the linear mixture MDP setting considered in prior work to the RKHS setting. The main result is to propose and algorithm called KernelCCE-VTR, which uses the principle of value-targeted regression to achieve regret bounds that scale with the effective dimension of the kernel. The authors also provide an improved variant of the algorithm based on Bernstein-type confidence bonuses.

The reviewers found the setting to be important and found the paper to be well-written, and agreed that the main results are technically challenging and likely to be a useful starting point for future work on learning Markov games with function approximation. The main issue raised by the reviewers is that the algorithm design and analysis appears to be based on a combination of well-known existing techniques for simpler settings---for the final revision, the paper can be strengthened by more strongly advocating for the novelty required in combining these techniques.

This work presents a straightforward and easy to understand method for using hypernetworks to adapt existing models to be able to increase their output space. The method itself is also interesting and is detailed enough for reproducibility. However, the experiments and results should be improved by expanding the demonstration of CHNs beyond the narrow P-VAE application and comparing against relevant baselines in the recommendation system literature.

Pros
- Clear writing.
- Detailed hyperparameters to aid reproducibility.
- Straightforward model.

Cons
- Lack of sufficient comparison to related work, especially to existing recommendation systems that handle the cold-start issue and to Vartak, 2017.
- Limited results that only demonstrate application to P-VAE meaning it's still unknown if CHNs work well with other models. The result on the synthetic dataset is also less persuasive.
- Lack of sufficient ablations, i.e. training a SVM/linear regression model until convergence.

The main goal of this paper is to develop a new adaptive strategy to remove the need of hyperparameter fine tuning, which hinders the performance of DGS (Zhang et al., 2020) method. This paper applies a line-search of the step-size parameter of DGS  to reduce tuning.  A heuristic update rule of the smooth parameter in DGS (Zhang et al., 2020)) is also used. 

Pros
+ The topic of learning hyperparameters on the fly is well-motivated and an important direction to improve many existing methods.
+ A wide range of tasks are considered in the experiments are interesting, with a wide range of tasks considered. 


Cons
- Reviewers have found the contribution to be incremental and marginal. Specifically, the reviewers have expressed concerns on the impact of the work since it verifies improvement upon DGS only. The paper could be stronger by showing evidence of improving other algorithms. 
-  In the work of [Zhang et. al., 2020], there are two parameters that require careful selection - the learning rate and smoothing radius. However, the proposed approach still relies on some hyperparameters. Although the authors claim that the method is not sensitive to these hyperparameters, it could be better justified. 
- The initial version lacks evaluation of the adaptive mechanism, although the authors added the comparison in the revised version. 
- The paper could be further improved by comparing against other hyperparameter optimization methods. 

We acknowledge the detailed response and the modifications of the manuscript. We believe the paper will make a more profound contribution and impact after addressing some of the major concerns raised by the reviewers.

This work avoids using a surrogate objective like previous works (DSAm DM, MTT) While also circumventing the computational constraints of other methods that optimize the true objective (DD, KIP)

The paper proposes a new algorithm for dataset distillation, based on two key ideas:  (1) train a linear layer given the fixed feature extractor, and (2) use a diverse set of modes as feature extractors. The paper has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Many reviewers find the algorithm effective, the paper well-written, and the results compelling. The rebuttal further addressed the concerns regarding the backbone models and missing experiments as well as provided additional clarifications. The AC agreed with the reviewers’ consensus and recommended accepting the paper.

The paper claims that a lot of previous work in QA-based MRC focused only on entity-aware common sense knowledge. To overcome this, the paper proposes to build a finer-grained local fact, (entity, predicate, entity) triplet, and then connect the triplet nodes with global information such as coreference. In the experiment section, the authors show that the proposed FOCAL REASONER outperforms the previous SOTA models.

* Interesting approach of producing semantically augmented LMs using dependency parses to extract svo triples, and finding coreferences between them across multiple sentences

Weaknesses:
* None of the reviewers seem particularly excited about the paper
* Stronger baseline comparisons would have improved the paper
* Authors re-define a lot of terminology, but the novelty of the method is more from the type of graph used to initialize their method, which seems to be a function of OpenIE triplets

The authors take two algorithmic components that were proposed in the context of discrete-action RL - priority replay and parameter noise - and evaluate them with DDPG on continuous control tasks. The different approaches are nicely summarized by the authors, however the contribution of the paper is extremely limited. There is no novelty in the proposed approaches, the empirical evaluation is inconclusive and limited, and there is no analysis or additional insights or results.

In ER, we are allowed to store a small subset of the incoming data stream, therefore deciding on a good policy to populate the memory buffer is important.

One way of avoiding catastrophic forgetting in continual learning is through keeping a memory buffer for experience replay.  This paper addresses the problem of online selection of representative samples for populating such memory buffer for experience replay.  The paper proposes novel information-theoretic criteria that selects samples that captures surprise (samples that are most informative) and learnability (to avoid outliers).  They utilize a Bayesian formulation to quantify informativeness. They provide two algorithms: a greedy approach, and an approach that takes timing (when to) update memory into account based on reservoir sampling to mitigate possible issues with class imbalance.

Pros:  The paper is well written and organized.  It was easy to follow. The formulation is novel and technically sound. The idea of taking learnability into account is novel and interesting.  It provides a nice way of avoiding outliers and balancing surprising information. The authors presented the motivation for each part of the framework well.  

Cons: To understand the contribution of each component of the formulation and competing criteria, an ablation study is needed.
Reviewers had several detailed suggestions and questions, including sensitivity to hyperparameters, additional citations, additional data sets beyond MNIST and CIFAR10, etc.  

In the rebuttal, the authors have addressed several of these concerns.  Please make sure to include and incorporate reviewer suggestions in the final revised version.

The papers studies machine learning tasks in the presence of adversarially corrupt data (during training). In particular, it is assumed that the labels of a small constant fraction of the datapoints are arbitrarily corrupted.  The paper proposes a natural method to solve this problem and evaluates it on various datasets. As pointed out by the reviewers, the theoretical contributions of this paper are subsumed by a number of prior works (which were not initially cited). The experimental results of the paper are interesting. However, the method proposed  and evaluated is not particularly novel. In my opinion, the problems studied in this submission are important (in particular, the memory/space consideration in the context of robustness).

Further, the AC agrees with the knowledgeable and responsible reviewer ZsKn that the presentation and experiments can be better positioned to highlight the key contribution.

### Paper summary 
This paper investigates theoretically and empirically the effect of increasing the number of parameters ("overparameterization") in GAN training. By analogy to what happens in supervised learning with neural networks, overparameterization does help to stabilize the training dynamics (and improve performance empirically). This paper provides an explicit threshold for the width of a 1-layer ReLU network generator so that gradient-ascent training with a linear discriminator yields a linear rate of convergence to the global saddle point (which corresponds to the empirical mean of the generator matching the mean of the data). The authors also provides a more general theorem that generalizes this result to deeper networks.

### Evaluation
The reviewers had several questions and concerns which were well addressed in the rebuttal and following discussion, in particular in terms of clarifying the meaning of "overparameterization". After discussing the paper, R1, R2 and R4 recommend acceptance while R3 recommends rejection. The main concern of R3 is that the GAN formulation analyzed in the paper is mainly doing moment matching between the generator  distribution (produced from a *fixed* set of latent variables z_i) and the empirical mean of the data. R3 argues that this is not sufficient to "understanding the training of GANs". At least two aspects are missing: how the distribution induced by the generator converges according to other notion of divergence (like KL, Wasserstein, etc.); and what about the true generator distribution (not just its empirical version from a fixed finite set of samples z_i)? While agreeing these are problematic, the other reviewers judged that the manuscript was useful first step in understanding the role of overparameterization in GANs and thus still recommend acceptance. And importantly, this paper is the first to study this question theoretically.

I also read the paper in more details. I have a feeling that some aspects of this work were already developed in the supervised learning literature; but the gradient descent-ascent dynamic aspect appears novel to me and the important question of the role of overparameterization here is both timely, novel and quite interesting. I side with R1, R2 and R4: this paper is an interesting first step, and thus I recommend acceptance. See below for additional comments to be taken in consideration for the camera ready version.

### Some detailed comments
- Beginning of section 2.3: please be clearer early on that you will keep V fixed to a random initialization rather than learning it. The fact that this is standard in some other papers is not a reason to not be clear about it.
- Theorem 2.2: in the closed form of the objective when $d$ is explicitly optimized, we are back to a more standard supervised learning formulation, for example (5) could look like regression. The authors should be more clear about this, and also mention in the main text that the core technical part used to prove Theorem 2.2 is from Oymak & Soltanolkotabi 2020 (which considers supervised learning). This should also a bit more clear in the introduction -- it seems to me that the main novelty of the work is to look at the gradient-descent dynamic, which is a bit different than the supervised learning setup, even though some parts are quite related (like the full maximization with respect to $d$).
- p.6 equation (8): typo -- the  $-\mu d_t$ term is redundant and should be removed as already included from $\nabla_d h(d,\theta)$.
- p.7 "numerical validations" paragraph: Please describe more clearly what is the meaning of "final MSE". Is this a global saddle point (and thus shows the limit of the generator to match the empirical mean), or is this coming from slowness of convergence of the method (e.g. after a fixed number of iterations, or according to some stopping criterion?). Please clarify.

Conformal prediction is similar to multi-label classification, but with a statistical sound way of thresholding each (class-specific) classifier. The concrete, deep implementation of the approach is rather straightforward and substandard for ICLR. Since a validation set is used to compute the quantiles, substantial 'power' is lost. The authors seem to be the first to attempt multiclass classification. They effectively build an independent classifier for each class that estimates whether an example comes from that class.

The reviewers all appreciated the novel concept behind the work. I agree with this, I think the principles behind the work are novel and interesting, and I would encourage the authors to improve the validation of this method and publish it in the future.

However, reviewers also raised a number of issues with the current paper: (1) the evaluation appears a bit preliminary, and could be improved significantly with additional datasets and more ablations/comparisons; (2) it's not clear if the improvements from the method are especially significant; (3) the writing could be improved (I do see that the authors made a significant number of changes and improved parts of the paper in response to reviewer concerns to a degree). Probably the writing issues could be fixed, but the skepticism about the experiment results seems harder to address, and while I recognize that the authors made an effort to point some existing ablations in the paper that do address parts of what the reviewers raised, I do think that in the balance the experimental results leave the validation of the work as somewhat borderline.

While less important for the decision, I found that the paper is somewhat overselling the contribution in the opening -- while the particular concept of using gradients as features in this way is interesting, similar ideas have been proposed in the past, and the paper would probably be better if it was more clearly positioned in the context of prior work rather than trying to present a new "framework" like this. It kind of feels like it's biting off too much in the opening, and then delivering a comparatively more modest (but novel and interesting!) technical component.

The paper studies offline RL, which is an important topic in high risk domains. Compared with the existing works, this paper gives a tractable method to explicitly learn the model representation w.r.t the stationary distributions of two policies. This method is pretty general and could be paired with other pessimistic model-based RL methods.

The experiments are limited to simpler domains, and could be extended to include harder tasks from other continuous control domains. Some examples could be domains such as in Robosuite (http://robosuite.ai/) or Robogym (https://github.com/openai/robogym). These environments have higher dimensional systems with clearer implications of representation learning. 

There are concerns on writing style and comprehension. 
- The work is on the one hand very specialized, on the other hand just an incremental modification of existing methods. 
- The presentation is very dense and quite hard to grasp, even with the Appendix.
- The formalism, while important, can be very loose in terms of bounds. While that does open questions in RL theory, it would be useful for authors to be more candid about this fact in the paper. 
I would recommend including the response to R1 in the paper.

Other relevant and concurrent papers to potentially take note of:
- Fine-Tuning Offline Reinforcement Learning with Model-Based Policy Optimization (https://openreview.net/forum?id=wiSgdeJ29ee) 
- Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning from Low-Quality Data (https://openreview.net/forum?id=uOjm_xqKEoX)

Given the overall positive reviews, I would recommend acceptance. However, the method would benefit from additional pass on re-writing to make the manuscript more accessible, which in turn to increase impact of this work.

This paper aims to look at the relationship between disentanglement
and multi-task learning.  The authors claim to show that disentanglement
emerges naturally from MTL.

The main discussion was whether the claim that disentanglement emerges
naturally from MTL has been adequately demonstrated.  The main  
issue is that MTL results in more extraction of information and that
is hard to disentangle from the disentanglement metrics used.

Reviewers agreed the work was interesting but not as complete as would
be desirable.  I also feel it is not ready for ICLR presentation, but

This work proposes a sparsity enforcing structure for GANs by splitting layers into the generator for the sparse vector and for the final image. The proposed method yielded improved performance over conventional methods in FID, IS for generators and PSNR for denoising with DIP. In practice it mostly boils down to encouraging sparsity in the last layer activations. The promised understanding of the network internals is forgotten in practice. The method is relatively simple and it could possibly be widely adopted if the experiments in the paper generalize to a wider range of problems.

This paper introduces sparse modeling-inspired regularizations to improve deep neural network-based image generators. Experimental results on both (low-resolution) image synthesis and deep image prior-based inverse problems are used to validate the proposed method.
The majority of the reviewers were against the acceptance of the paper. As summarized by Reviewer tsoA: "There are shortcomings in the overall concept as well as its evaluation. The findings suggest that this might be a promising avenue of research, but it would need to be taken further. At present, the paper boils down too much into simply adding a simple regularizer at the end and observing that it somewhat improves some metrics in a limited number of scenarios. Due to the limitations of the evaluation, it remains unclear whether the proposed improvement carries over to state of the art models and datasets. Similarly, the promised elucidation of the purpose of the feature values never really materializes." The AC agrees with that summarization and recommends rejection.

The paper studies the approximation properties of group convolutional neural networks. It establishes the “cc-universality” of group CNNs, i.e. that such networks can approximate any continuous function over any compact set, using a new constructive approach which is based on a generalization of the ridgelet transform. The proof is constructive, in the sense that approximating networks are given in closed form by discretizing the transform. This approach may have applications beyond the scope of the paper — most immediately, to identifying classes of functions for which neural network approximations are accurate in a quantitative sense; this can be tied to the decay properties of the ridgelet transform. Reviewers found the paper to be clearly written and of high technical quality, albeit somewhat mathematically dense in its presentation. Universal approximation theorems provide an important piece of theoretical background, as well as a “sanity check” for new network architectures; having a unified, constructive approach to derive them could stimulate further work.

This paper presents a new NAS benchmarks for hardware-aware NAS. For each of the architectures in the search space of NAS-Bench-201, it measures hardware performance (energy cost and latency) for six different hardware devices. This is extremely useful for the NAS research community, since it takes very specialized hardware domain knowledge (including machine learning development frameworks, device compilation, embedded systems, and device measurements) as well as the hardware to make these hardware-aware measurements on as many as six (very different) devices. 

The code has been made available to the reviewers during the author response window and has been checked by the reviewers in the meantime. All reviewers appreciated the paper and gave (clear) acceptance scores. 

Before this work, it was very hard for the average NAS researcher to assess their method properly in a hardware-aware setting, and I expect this work to change this, and to open up the very important field of hardware-aware NAS to many more researchers. For this reason I recommend to accept this paper as a spotlight.

This paper gives a way to learn one-hidden-layer neural networks on when the input comes from Gaussian mixture model. The main algorithm uses [Janzamin et al. 2014] as an initialization and then performs gradient descent. The main contribution of this paper is 1. to give a characterization of sample complexity for estimating the moment tensors when the input distribution comes from a mixture of Gaussian; 2. to give a local convergence result when the samples come from a mixture of Gaussian. The paper claims certain behavior in the input data would make the problem harder and slow down the convergence, although the claim is based on an upperbound and would be stronger if there is some corresponding lowerbound.

The paper presents a new Bayesian optimization method based on the Gaussian process bandits framework for black-box adversarial attacks. The method achieves good performance in the experiments, which was appreciated by all the reviewers.

At the same time, the presentation of the method is quite confusing, which currently precludes acceptance of the paper. In particular, during the discussion phase the reviewers were not able to decipher the algorithm based on the description presented in the paper. It is not clear how the problem is modeled as a bandit problem, what the loss function $\ell$ is minimized and why minimizing it makes sense (assuming, e.g., that $\ell$ it the hinge loss as suggested and the initial prediction is good with a large margin, that is, the loss is zero, equation 6 never changes $x_t$ when the procedure is started from $x$). This connection, since it is the fundamental contribution of the paper, should be much better explained. Once the problem is set up to estimate (maximize?) the reward, it is changed to calculating the difference in the minimization (cf. equation 11), which is again unmotivated. (Other standard aspects of the algorithm should also be explained properly, e.g., the stopping condition of Algorithm 1)

Unfortunately, the paper is written in a mathematically very imprecise manner. As an example, consider equation (6), where $B_p$ and the projection operator are not defined, and while these can be guessed, a projection of the argmin seems to be missing as well in the end (otherwise nothing guarantees that $x_T$, which is the final outcome of the algorithm, remains in the $L_p$ ball). Another example is the $Discrete\ Approximate\ CorrAttack_{Flip}$ paragraph which requires that every coordinate of $x$ should be changed by  $\pm\epsilon$. It is also not clear what "dividing the image into several blocks" means in Section 4.1 (e.g., are these overlapping, do they cover the whole image, etc., not to mention that previously $x$ was a general input, not necessarily an image). It is also unlikely that the stopping condition in Algorithm 1 would use the exact same $\epsilon$ for the acquisition function as the perturbation radius for adversarial examples, etc. While some of these inaccuracies and unclear definitions are also mentioned in the reviews, unfortunately there are more in the paper.

The authors are encouraged to resubmit the paper to the next venue after significantly improving and cleaning up the presentation.

This submission describes an approach to compressing the communication in federated learning. The key idea is using a set of random samples from a prior distribution and then performing importance weighed sampling. The work performs an analysis of the privacy guarantees of this process and experimental evaluation.
The main issue with this work is the authors appear to be unaware that the basic problem they pose is solved in a more comprehensive and lossless way in a recent work https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12099 (Feldman and Talwar, ICML 2021). That work shows that any differentially private randomizer can be compressed via a simpler algorithm that performs rejection sampling using a PRG. The algorithm does not loose privacy or utility (under standard cryptographic assumptions) while guaranteeing low communication. In contrast this work loses significantly in utility and provides opaque privacy guarantees.
This submission analyzes  a randomized that adds Gaussian distribution and, in particular, the compression technique in (Feldman and Talwar) applies to it. The technique proposed in this work is very similar in spirit (with prior distribution corresponding to reference distribution in the earlier work.
In light of the earlier work I do not think the contributions in this submission are sufficient for publication.

This paper focuses on the problem of performing imitation learning from trajectory-level data that includes optimal as well as suboptimal demonstrations.  The authors wish to avoid the requirement of a separate filtering process that would throw away the bad trajectories.  The authors propose a clever innovation that allows for leveraging the policy that is itself being learned to reweight the samples for a next round of weighted behavioral cloning.  The paper is also somewhat theoretically rigorous and provides insight into the problem. 

The reviewers pointed out some initial issues related to clarity and the authors did a good job of addressing reviewer concerns.  Ultimately all reviewers agreed that the core innovation of the paper was interesting and empirically worked reasonably well.  

One older line of work that I think is quite relevant, but which is not discussed, is the empirically observed "clean-up effect", described by Michie and colleagues in the 90s (e.g. "Learning to fly" Sammut et al 1992).  This clean-up effect is intuitive and reportedly achieved for free in settings where the learning objective is mode-seeking and the dataset is large, insofar as the mean value of the resulting policy *should* produce actions that corresponds to the average action produced by demonstrators in the same situation.  I think it would be worth discussing how the analysis of this paper relates to this empirical phenomenon. In particular, it would be worth clarifying in what regimes the suboptimality of training from a dataset with noisy examples arises and how likely this is to effect the mean value of the learned policy (for context, it is fairly common in practice to evaluate the student policy in BC settings by only using the mean action value; perhaps this point was present in the paper, and I missed it). From a certain perspective, the innovation of this paper is to accentuate the clean-up effect.

As noted by a reviewer, and subsequently incorporated into the paper, the actual algorithm has some similarities to versions of recent "offline RL" algorithms (though of course it does not leverage rewards).  In particular, the motif of performing a weighted regression could perhaps be a bit more thoroughly contextualized by connecting it to other weighting factors (e.g. see Critic Regularized Regression).  That said, I leave this entirely to the discretion of the authors.

The final scores were 8, 7, & 6.  I see this as a strong paper and will endorse it for a spotlight.

The paper advocates Equivariance Self-Supervised Learning (E-SSL) as a more general framework than Invariance SSL. The proposed E-SSL framework boils down to adding an additional equivariance objective (mainly 4-fold rotations) to popular I-SSL methods. The empirical results show encouraging results in CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. The advantage of the proposed method is demonstrated relative to SimCLR and SimSiam on Cifar-10, ImageNet, and a new scientific application domain: learning frequency responses of photonic crystals.

This paper proposes an extra loss to add on top of the contrastive learning. The contrastive learning seek representations invariant to transformation, while the extra loss the authors proposed encourage representations to be equivariant to the transformation (i.e. retain information about transformation in later representations). While reviewers and I agree this is a sensible motivation, and acknowledge good results that authors have obtained, the fact that most, if not all, improvement is combing from the 4-way rotation transformation is a bit unsatisfactory. Furthermore, this additional loss was proposed before and is actually quite well known, so the actual novelty in the proposed technique is somewhat limited. Nevertheless, this paper provides a comprehensive evaluation, obtaining a reasonable improvement, and makes a good case for using an equivariant seeking loss. The authors are strongly encouraged to release their code (including training details for reproducing ImageNet results) as the improvements they present are central to the acceptance.

The paper proposes a system for using natural language feedback generated by large language models(LLMs) to improve task planning in embodied environments. The system does not require training a specialized model for the task and uses pre-trained models prompted with information from the environment. Three types of environment feedback, i.e. success detection, passive and active scene descriptions, are expressed in language. It is unclear which type of feedback should be active at each time step.

This paper presents a closed loop planning system that leverages LLMs for providing candidate plans given the success of action execution and the world state. Central to the approach is querying the LLM given the instruction and text prompts capturing success of skill execution and a description of the scene. 

This is a systems oriented paper demonstrating and evaluating the utility of a LLM for interleaved planning and execution. The paper is well organised and clearly written. The results highlight the utility of LLMs to enable task execution before an explicit learning of a task model (given primitive robot skills amenable to composition). Further, experiments demonstrate contextual plan adaptation and success goal reaching for simulated and real data sets. 

The main limitation of the work was observed to be the specialised nature of feedback prompts necessary for successful task execution. A clarification was sought if the proposed system has a principled way to determining the necessary feedback and to what extent the feedback is to be adjusted for long-running plans. In response, the authors clarified that the feedback is not hand crafted. Further,  the authors articulated their contribution towards demonstrating  the ability of LLM-based planners to integrated multi-modal feedback without focusing on the specific problem of determine how much or how best such a feedback may be generated. In response to a reviewer’s suggestion, the authors provided a comparison of models with and without feedback with an increase in the task horizon. 

Additionally, the reviewers inquired the degree to which plan recovery is possible in the proposed framework. In response, the authors drew attention to results where plan adaptation occurs when an object falls is no longer in the reachable workspace. The reviewers further requested for a comparison with a baseline that searches over a set of high-candidate plans. As suggested, the authors provided a comparison with a Next Best Decoding that uses the next most likely skill. 

Overall, the inclusion of new experimental insights strengthens the paper. A clear articulation of the technical advance in relation to Zang et al. 2022 is also recommended in the main manuscript.

This paper presents a significant collection of unlabelled signing data (4.6K hours) across 10 sign languages, which have been pre-processed and converted to pose-keypoints to remove identifiable information. The paper also presents Multi-ISLR a multilingual dataset with label-alignment extracted from 11 other labelled datasets for 7 sign languages. Furthermore, the paper also provides a multilingual model, Sign2Vec, pre-trained on the unlabelled data, and fine-tuned on the labelled data, which shows the SOTA results for known tasks. Lastly, the paper also introduces a dataset for fingerspelling across 7 languages. It's likely that this work will pave the way for new research on multilingual signed language tasks.

* The data gathering procedure is well documented and justified
* The experimental results provide evidence of the value of the data.


**cons**
* For the SignCorpus there is a lack of a human verification process, that assesses the quality of the pose keypoints; i.e. whether they can be used by native signers to extract the target gloss.

The authors propose a simple solution to this problem, take top-K most frequently chosen items, and prove that it is near optimal.

The proposed approach is evaluated on locomotion tasks, and is shown to be overall more data efficient than alternative baselines.

This work presents a method for training neural nets on synthetic data. This data is collected from a collection of thousands of OpenGL programs that rendered images, which are then used for representation learning. The big advantage of this approach is that it avoids of a lot of the biases that are present in natural image datasets. The proposed method is competitive for supervised and unsupervised scenarios.

There is a somewhat persistent concern that simply demonstrating that a stronger visual encoder leads to improvements downstream is not an insightful result on which the community can build.

New method has interpretation of Frank-Wolfe algorithm. To decrease the variance of the dual gradients, one can use a parallel mini-batching, which provides the method with a provable acceleration given a set of parallel computational units. The significance is unclear, especially given what appears to be a significant gap between the theory and the experiments. The presentation of the parallelized algorithm has the flavor of being dishonest. The experiments are very far away from the theory.

The authors design an algorithm for composite stochastic optimization that leverages both smoothness and strong convexity with respect to the same (general) norm, using a stochastic counterpart to recent work by Diakonikolas and Guzman. They then show how to leverage this algorithm and randomized smoothing in order to create an algorithm for constrained smooth convex optimization based on exact gradient evaluations and linear optimization computations. Compared to Frank-Wolfe, the algorithm requires strictly less gradient evaluations and parallelizes the same amount of linear optimization computations.

The paper received generally favorable reviews, with the exception of reviewer 3QVT who did not engage in discussion and whose critique I found unclear. I agree with reviewer rQnJ’s assessment that even though “all the building block are quite known in optimization community (accelerated methods, duality, Bregman distances, smoothing, etc.), the whole approach fits perfectly together and provides the reader with a number of nice and useful observations.” Consequently, I recommend acceptance.

The paper leverages the recent breakthrough of Masked AutoEncoders (MAE) for the domain of robotics. It shows that visual knowledge can be transferred from different domains such as ego4d into specific robotics domains thanks to MAE. The paper finds that MAE is superior to CLIP pretraining. This paper evaluates vision encoders pretrained using masked autoencoders on large scale datasets. The baselines compare to only ViT architectures. These are generally harder to train than simpler conv architectures like ResNet.

The problem of group robustness (in terms of worst-group performance) is particularly challenging when some groups are underrepresented in the training data. Classical approaches use under/over-sampling, reweighting, and two-phase training to deal with this issue. The authors propose to use contrastive adapters without retraining from scratch. The paper shows that neither a naive version of the zero-shot, nor linear probing on the target dataset, is the optimal choice.

This paper presents a model to identify entity mentions that are synonymous.  This could have utility in practical scenarios that handle entities.

The main criticism of the paper is regarding the baselines used.  Most of the baselines that are compared against are extremely simple.  There is a significant body of literature that models paraphrase and entailment and many of those baselines are missing (decomposable attention, DIIN, other cross-attention mechanisms).  Adding those experiments would make the experimental setup stronger.

There is a bit of a disagreement between reviewers, but I agree with the two reviewers who point out the weakness of the experimental setup, and fixing those issues could improve the paper significantly.

This paper develops a smoothing procedure to avoid the problem of posterior collapse in VAEs. The method is interesting and novel, the experiments are well executed, and the authors answered satisfactorily to most of the reviewers' concerns. However, there is one remaining issue that would require additional discussion. As identified by Reviewer 1, the analysis in Section 3 is only valid when the number of layers is 2. Above that value, "it is possible to construct models where the ELBO has a reasonable value, but the smoothed objective behaves catastrophically". Thus, the scope of the analysis in Section 3 deserves further discussion. Given the large number of ICLR submissions, this paper unfortunately does not meet the acceptance bar. That said, I encourage the authors to address this point and resubmit the paper to another (or the same) venue.

This work considers the graph task of learning node representations that are invariant to small edge perturbations. It achieves this through a data augmentation procedure that samples new ‘fake’ edges and regularizes the GNN equivariant representations to be unable to predict these fake edges. The paper falls well within the scope of the conference. Its writing could be improved and would benefit from a thorough language revision. The state-of-the-art is appropriately identified and even though its novelty is somehow incremental, its value seems beyond doubt.

The paper is concerned with learning transformation equivariant node representation of graph data in an unsupervised setting. The paper extends prior work in this topic by focusing on equivariance under topology transformations (adding/removing edges) and considering an information theoretic perspective. Reviewers highlighted the promising ideas of the approach, its relevance for the ICLR community, and the promising experimental results (although improvements over prior work are not necessarily significant on all benchmarks).

However, reviewers raised concerns regarding the novelty of the method and the clarity of presentation with respect to key parts of the method. These aspects connect also to further concerns raised, e.g., related to mathematical correctness as well as the significance of the proposed loss function, the benefits of motivating it from MI, and the improvements over GraphTER. The rebuttal didn't fully clarify these points. While the paper is mostly solid, I agree with the reviewers' concerns and -- currently -- the paper doesn't clear the bar for acceptance; it would require another revision to improve upon these points. However, I'd encourage the authors to revise and resubmit their work with considering this feedback.

Red is a new methodology to produce reliable confidence scores to detect missclassification errors in neural networks. The method is straightforward to implement and performs well against the baselines considered on classification tasks for 125 UCI datasets. It is not demonstrated whether RED would outperform other confidence scoring and OOD detection methods. Unless there is a good justification for the limited set of baselines, I believe the paper's claims to generality are limited. It would be good to apply SVGP directly to some of these datasets and compare the results against NN+SVGP results.

In this paper, the authors use a GP classifier to detect if the output of a NN classifier has been decided correctly. The GP takes as input the original input vector x and the output of the NN, i.e. the calibrated posterior probabilities given by the NN. It uses that as an input vector for the GP classifier to decide if the sample was correctly decided. The output of the GP will serve as confidence in the output of the NN. The results are comparable/superior with the state-of-the-art and the authors have repeated the experiments with over 125 different datasets. The reviewers of this paper were all cautiously positive about the paper, but all of them pointed towards the reduced novelty of the paper. Also, none of the reviewers were willing to champion this paper as a must-have at ICLR 2021.
 
For my reading of the paper, I would tend to agree with the reviewers’ comments. Also, I find that using the same NN, rather shallow, with the same configuration for all the datasets seems rather limited. Given that this method is independent of the underlying classifier and that the databases used are low dimensions and a low number of training examples, I would have liked to see what a random forest or a GP can accomplish. Also, I would have used bigger NNs that can be trained to overfit the sigmoid outputs for classification of higher accuracy. I believe that having a diversity of underlying classifiers is more relevant than having 125 datasets. We need to find the best classifier or ensemble and then apply the different mechanisms for estimating if the output is the correct one. Otherwise, the proposed method might only be workable for this specific NN configuration. In the tables, it can be hinted that this might be happening, as about 80% of the cases MCP and RED are indistinguishable in the AUROC values.
 
Also, for all of these datasets a GP could be used as an underlying classifier, and given the premises of this paper, the authors could check how well calibrate a GP classifier is. Also, there has been considerable work on calibrating NNs when they are trained to overfit. Comparing with those methods should be straightforward, as they provide more information than just a confidence score. This is probably the most influential paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04599 (1000+ references), but there are some recent papers too.  
 
Finally, if the goal is to use a GP to detect if the classification done by the NNs is accurate, using a GP might be an overkill, as the complexity of the GP, especially for large datasets might end up being larger than the underlying classifier.

Gold Metareview 397:
The paper is proposing a new framework for understanding generalization in the deep learning. The main idea is considering the difference of stochastic optimization on a population risk and optimization on an empirical risk. The classical theory considers the difference of empirical risk and population risk. This basically translates the practical motivation from finding good function classes to finding good optimizers which can re-use the data effectively. Although the paper provides no theoretical result, it provides an interesting empirical study. The paper somewhat demonstrates that SGD on deep networks is somehow good at re-using the same data. I believe this angle is very novel and might hope to future theoretical discoveries. The paper is reviewed by four reviewers and two of them argue its acceptance and two of them argue rejection. After discussion, this status remained and I carefully read and reviewed the paper. Here are the major issues raised by the reviewers:

- R#1: The paper is missing a theoretical study. The implications on the practical deep learning is not clear.
- R#2: Choice of the soft-error is particular to the task and how to go beyond soft-max is not clear.
- R#3: Finds the paper not novel as well as trivial or hard to understand.
- R#4: The choice of soft error is ad-hoc.

I believe the issues raised by R#3 are not justified. First of all, novelty is very clear and. appreciated by other reviewers. Moreover, the paper is rather easy to understand and the results are very farm from trivial. However, the other issues raised by other reviewers are valid. Specifically, soft-error seems to be a limitation of the study. However, the authors respond to this concern and reviewer increases their score. I believe the theory is lacking but the paper is simply showing this novel approach and its empirical validity. A theory to explain this phenomenon would be amazing but not necessary for publication. Similarly, without a theory it is hard to expect any practical implication. Overall, I believe the paper is an interesting and novel one which will likely to lead additional work in the area. Considering we are still far from a satisfying theory of generalization for deep learning and the role of the optimization is clear, this angle worth sharing with the community. Hence, I decide to accept. However, I have some concerns which should be addressed by the camera-ready. 

- Claims should be revised and authors should make sure they have enough evidence for them. For example, authors provide no satisfying evidence for random labels or very limited evidence for pre-training. I strongly recommend authors to either remove some of these discussions or present in a fashion which is not a result but part of the discussion for future research.
- A section about limitations should be added. Specifically, the soft-error choice should be discussed in this limitation section.
- Discussion section should be extended with the pointers to the relevant work on bootstrap literature as well as suggestions to the theoreticians. Not providing any theoretical result is always fine but authors should understanding why is it hard to make theoretical statements and where to search them.

This idea is a combination of episodic memory techniques and “goal-oriented” reinforcement learning. 

After the authors’ responses and the discussion phase, all reviewers converged to recommending the rejection of this paper. The main concerns regarding this paper are:

* Presentation. The proposed approach is not that well justified, some of the claims in the paper are quite imprecise, and there’s relevant related work missing.
* Evaluation. The evaluation sometimes feels rushed and is not held in a diverse enough set of tasks, not capturing important properties one would want to capture.

I recommend the authors to pay close attention to presentation, as well as the experiments and analysis in order to make the paper stronger.

the authors propose to incorporate an additional layer between the consecutive steps in LSTM by introducing a radial basis function layer (with dot product kernel and softmax) followed by a linear layer to make LSTM similar to or better at (by being more explicit) capturing DFA-like transition. the motivation is relatively straightforward, but it does not really resolve the issue of whether existing formulations of RNN's cannot capture such transition. since this was not shown theoretically nor intuitively, it is important for empirical evaluations to be thorough and clearly show that the proposed approach does indeed outperform the vanilla LSTM (with peepholes) when the capacity (e.g., the number of parameters) matches. unfortunately it has been the consensus among the reviewers that more thorough comparison on more conventional benchmarks are needed to convince them of the merit of the proposed approach.

This paper focuses on the task of 3D mesh stylization according to the text prompt.

This paper presents a new CLIP-driven stylization method given an input mesh and text description. Compared to previous works Text2Mesh, the paper introduces a more expressive rendering model based on learnable SVBRDF and normal maps. Many reviewers found the paper easy to follow, the idea promising, and the results visually appealing. They also expressed their concerns regarding the similarity to Text2Mesh, the limitations of the normal maps approach (compared to changing geometry explicitly), and the relighting and material editing of the stylized object. The rebuttal has addressed most of the concerns. The AC agreed with most of the reviewers and recommended accepting the paper. 

Please revise the papers according to the reviewer’s comments: (1) change the title according to Reviewer kpuS, (2) add relighting/material editing/view synthesis results, and (3) highlight the pros and cons of the proposed method w.r.t. Text2Mesh.

Distilled Gradient Aggregation (DGA) approach combines the advantages of both global IG and local FG approaches via a new sequential feature distillation algorithm. The DGA approach effectively addresses the limitations of local approach (FullGrad) that uses a single anchor point to compute attribution. DGA is motivated by problems of some related work, i.e. Integrated Gradient and FullGrad. The current way the method is presented to the audience is quite confusing.

This paper proposes a new gradient-based attribution method Distilled Gradient Aggregation (DGA), which combines the strengths of both local and global attribution methods. The reviewers and meta-reviewer found the method novel, and supported by promising results both qualitatively and quantitatively. 

During the rebuttal phase, the authors made a _thorough_ effort in response to each reviewer's comments. As recognized by two reviewers (hnze, cvDy), the newly added results and discussions have significantly strengthened the contribution. 

The AC recommends acceptance given the paper tackles a critical problem, and presented an effective and convincing method that advances the field of explainable AI.

This paper discusses the oversmoothing in transformer models such as BERT. It proposes a hierarchical fusion method as a solution. Theoretical analysis is new and provides interesting findings. The proposed fusion methods are not that novel and not well theoretically and empirically proved. The author applied a novel approach to shed light on an insufficiently investigated problem. Overall, I vote for accepting this paper. The analysis is from the perspective of viewing BERT and Transformer as graph neural networks. It is not completely new but applicable to analysis on transformers.

This paper has a deep analysis of the over-smoothing phenomenon in BERT from the perspective of graph. Over-smoothing refers to token uniformity problem in BERT, different input patches mapping to similar latent representation in ViT and the problem of shallower representation better than deeper (overthinking). The authors build a relationship between Transformer blocks and graphs. Namely, self-attention matrix can be regarded as a normalized adjacency matrix of a weighted graph. They prove that if the standard deviation in layer normalization is sufficiently large, the outputs of the transformer stack will converge to a low-rank subspace, resulting in over-smoothing.

In this paper, they also provide theoretical proof why higher layers can lead to over-smoothing. Empirically , they investigate the effects of the magnitude of the two standard deviations between two consecutive layers on possible over-smoothing in diverse tasks.

In order to overcome over-smoothing, they propose a series of hierarchical fusion strategy that adaptively fuses presentation from different layers, including concatenation fusion, max fusion and self-gate fusion into post-normalization. These strategies reduce similarities between tokens and outperforms BERT baseline on a few datasets (GLUE, SWAG and SQuAD).

Overall I agree with reviewers that this is a good contribution.

This paper presents U-WILDS, an extension of the multi-task, large-scale domain-shift dataset WILDS. The authors propose an extensive array of experiments evaluating the ability of a wide variety of algorithms to leverage the unlabelled data to address domain-shift problems. The vision behind sounds quite ambitious and convincing to me, namely, the proposed U-WILDS benchmark would be a useful and well-motivated resource for the ML community, and their experiments were very comprehensive. Although they did not introduce any new methods in this paper, U-WILDS significantly expands the range of modalities, applications, and shifts available for studying and benchmarking real-world unsupervised adaptation.

Thus, all of us have agreed to strongly accept this paper for publication! Please include the additional rebuttal discussion in the next version.

This paper studies the performance of second-order algorithms on training multi-layers over-parameterized neural networks. The authors propose an algorithm based on the Gram-Gauss-Newton method, tensor-based sketching techniques, and preconditioning to train such a network, whose runtime is subquadratic in the width of the neural network. While some reviewers provide some weak support, none of them are in strong support, even after the author's response. I think one of the reasons is the lack of empirical experiments. Since the main claim of this paper is an efficient second-order algorithm, some experiments are necessary to back up this claim. Unfortunately, the authors did not try to add such an experiment during the rebuttal. I would suggest the authors add such experiments in the revision.

This paper explores why adversarial examples do not transfer well in
adversarial examples on automatic speech recognition systems. The authors
propose a number of potential causes that are then quickly evaluated in
turn.

This could be an excellent paper, but in its current form, it is borderline.
The main problem with the paper is that it proposes a number of causes for the
limited transferability, and then evaluates each of them with one quick
experiment and just a paragraph of text. In particular, none of the results
actually convince me that the claim is definitely correct, and many of the
experimental setups are confusing or would have other explanations other than
the one variable that is aiming to be controlled for.

That said, even with these weaknesses, this paper raises interesting and new
questions with an approach I have not seen previosuly. So while I don't believe
the paper has done much to actually demystify transferability, it does take
steps towards performing scientific experiments to understand why it is so
hard. And these experiments, while not perfect, can serve as the basis for
future work to extend and understand which factors are most important.

A method for OOD generalization is proposed. To prevent a model from learning "shortcut features" (simple features which do not work in OOD setting~spurious correlations), an autoencoder is trained. The explorer model is then trained on the reconstructed image. Some of the shortcut features were hopefully removed by AE to fool the Blocked model. The approach was evaluated on ColorMNIST, CelebA and BAR benchmarks. The results on CMNIST are not directly comparable to prior work due to a different model architecture.

The paper provides an algorithm for the stochastic multi armed bandit (MAB) problem in the regime with fairness constraints. It continues a line of work that in high level define fairness as a requirement to ensure a minimum amount of exploration for every arm.
The main concern I found in the reviews regards the definition of fairness in this paper. Although it follows the same high level narrative of previous works its exact definition and difference from previous papers is not convincingly motivated, and seems to be tailored to the proposed algorithm rather to a real world fairness constraint. This issue could have been mitigated by a novel or generalizable technique, or insightful experiments, but this does not seem to be the case given the reviewers comment about the limited novelty and basic experiments.

Description:
The paper presents a method for encoding a compressed version of an implicit 3D scene, from given images from arbitrary view points. This is achieved via a function, learning with a NeRF model, that maps spatial coordinates to a radiance vector field and is optimized for high compressibility and low reconstruction error. Results shows better compression, higher reconstruction quality and lower bitrates compared to other STOA.

Strengths:
- Method for significantly compressing NerF models, which is very useful since such models are often trained for every new scene
- Retain reconstruction quality after compression by an order of magnitude
 
Weaknesses:
- The need for decompressing the model before rendering can be done means reduced rendering speed. This also requires longer training times.
- Experiments against other scene compression + neural rendering technique will have further strengthened the papers’s claims 
- The techniques used are well established, and thus there is not as much technical novelty.

It shows that SGD can converge to local maxima with high probability for specific cases.

Overall, the paper provides interesting counter examples for the SGD with constant step-size (that relies on a relative noise model that diminishes at the critical points), which provide critical (counter) insights into what we consider as good convergence metrics, such as expected norm of the gradient. 

The initial submission took a controversial position between the mathematical statements and the presentation of the statements on the behavior of the SGD method in non-convex optimization problems. While the mathematical is sufficient for acceptance at ICLR, the presentation was inferring conclusions that could have been misread by the community.

This work is well written and accurately covers the context and recent related work. It's a good example of how to apply self-supervised training to the event sequence domain.

- Extensive evaluation.
- Well formulated problem.

Cons:
- Lack of technical novelty. The method appears to be general to all sequences rather than specialized for event sequences so the motivation for this design is not crystal clear.
- Minor improvement in results from using the method despite written claims that the method 'significantly outperforms'.
- Limited analysis that shows the periodicity and repeatability in the data.

It is typically employed with a tabular policy, limiting its applicability to large games.

The authors provided some justification about using previous networks as initialization, but this is an insufficient discussion to understand the soundness of the strategy. The paper should better discuss this more, even if it is not possible to provide theory.

Gold Metareview 430:
The paper is about adapting a voice generation model to new speakers with minimal amount of training data. The key insight in this paper is that the voice can be adapted using a small set of variables -- the bias and the variance associated with the layer that normalizes the mel-spectrogram associated with the decoder. Additionally, they characterize voice at the utterance level to capture stationary factors like background acoustic conditions and at the phoneme level to capture factors such as prosody, though there are no explicit constraints to force such representation.

The strength of the paper are:
+ Simplicity of the approach
+ Empirical evaluation that demonstrates its effectiveness

The weakness of the paper are:
- analysis of what the crucial parameters of the model represent
- lack of clarity that is obvious from several back-and-forths between the reviewers and the author.

A few examples include:
- “There is also a phoneme-level acoustic embedding which is used in the same way, which at inference is taken from random sentences (why not in training?), and, I guess, is supposed to cover phoneme-level idiosyncrasies of the speaker, although this isn't clear to me.”
- “ it is only the speaker embedding that is the input to fine-tuning, and this only via the normalization parameters.

The authors introduce a simple extension of PPO that uses a single expert demonstration and a modified sampling algorithm to show better performance than vanilla PPO in a difficult 3D setting. This is fundamentally good material. It's not groundbreakingly new but I think it could make for an easy-to-use imitation learning baseline that would help in a lot of scenarios. The method is tested on four environment variations, as constructed in the Animal-AI Olympics challenge env.

There was quite a bit of internal discussion on this paper. To summarize:
- The idea is very neat and interesting and likely to work
- The paper is likely to inspire future work
- There are still serious doubts  about the experimental evaluation that is not entirely up to par with current standards
  - The reviewers were not convinced 100% by the arguments about the 'custom' environments
  - The reviewers were not convinced 100% that the baselines were given their best shot

While the paper has potential to provide valuable input for the community, it needs a bit more work before being presentable at a highly competitive venue like ICLR.

This paper studies the model-based reinforcement learning. They propose a posterior sampling algorithm and provide a Bayesian regret guarantee. Under the assumption that the reward and transition functions are Gaussian processes with linear kernels, the regret bound is in the order of H^1.5 d sqrt{T} The definition of $BayesRegret$ seems incorrect as it takes $M^*$ as input argument. There is no study on fundamental limit.

The paper could use some more discussion and careful definitions. The literature section on exact (homotopy) methods for the elastic net and the lasso is lacking. It is not clear that the bound on the number of problems needed for a certain accuracy would be a useful addition. The paper seems to be theoretically sound and follows a logical progression. The authors show that, given a set of validation losses and a distribution over this set, a possibly small number of draws from this distribution are needed to minimize the average validation loss.

The reviewers agreed that this paper should be accepted -- it studies an interesting and in someways "overlooked" problem and seems like it could be a starting point for others to build on. The paper did have some weaknesses. For example, we feel that the lack of experimental results is a missed opportunity -- the reviewers feel the paper would be made stronger by including at least a simple example where the standard approach of grid search + CV fails. Without such an example, it is a bit hard to be convinced of the importance of the problem being studied.

The paper addresses learning the ratio between two densities from their samples. The paper is well written, although quite difficult to follow without some theoretical background. It is unclear to me how strong the theoretical claims are. I am also concerned about the reasoning behind several claims and the potential gap between the derived theory and experiments. The authors propose a new risk estimator for DRE, providing a non-negative Bregman divergence estimator, with the non- negative correction.

This paper discusses the likelihood ratio estimation using the Bregman divergence.  The authors consider the 'train-loss hacking', which is an overfitting issue causing minus infinity for the divergence.   They introduce non-negative correction for the divergence under the assumption that we have knowledge on the upper bound of the density ratio.  Some theoretical results on the convergence rate are given.  The proposed method shows favorable performance on outlier detection and covariate shift adaptation.

The proposed non-negative modification of Bregman divergence is a reasonalbe solution to the important problem of density ratio estimation.  The experimental results as well as theoretical justfication make this work solid.  However, there are some concerns also.  The paper assumes knowledge on the upper bound of density ratio and uses a related parameter essentially in the method.  Assuming the upper bound  is a long standing problem in estimating density ratio, and it is in practice not necesssarily easy to obtain.  Also, there is a room on improvements on readability. 

Although this paper has some signicance on the topic, it does not reach the acceptance threshold unfortunately because of the high competition in this years' ICLR.

The final scores for this submission are borderline, but the reviewers seem to agree on the positives (the contributions of the dataset itself) while the authors have gone through great lengths to address criticisms in terms of number of algorithms compared, the size of the dataset, the ability of the dataset to generalize to the real world, and the writing quality. Reviewer MHDH was also very thorough to catch an unintended overlap of train and test data, which the authors corrected. Taken as a whole, I believe the authors have done a great job addresses the perceived weaknesses of the manuscript and dataset. I also believe it is not obvious that deep methods would generalize from passive to active stereo (a concern of reviewer MHDH), so I believe this is a worthwhile study.

The paper proposes an ensemble approach, called SRR (Self-supervise, Refine, Repeat), for robust unsupervised anomaly detection. The idea is to filter out potential anomaly samples (data refinement) by ensemble model. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on top of contrastive learning-based models. SRR brings the advantages of making the anomaly decision boundaries more robust and giving better data representations. The paper is ready for acceptance.

The paper worked on fully unsupervised anomaly detection and proposed to use self-supervised representation learning to improve the performance of one-class classification. This is a borderline case close to acceptance but cannot make it. Specifically, it is useful, but its novelty is the main issue, since it is not surprising that self-supervised representation learning can improve one-class classification without representation learning (this part is still much of the taste of ICLR) and an ensemble of multiple models can improve upon a single model (which is just "bootstrap aggregating" or "bagging" used everyday in practice and known to machine learning and statistics societies a very long time ago). After seeing the rebuttal, the concerns were not really addressed well and the issues were only partially solved. Thus, the paper is not enough to guarantee an acceptance to ICLR unfortunately.

It is also a bit unclear why training a model to predict beliefs would be faster than just calculating them (after all the data must come from somewhere)..

The paper proposes a discretization of Wasserstein gradient flow with an euler scheme, and propose a way to estimate each step of the euler scheme using ratio estimators from samples regularized with gradient penalties. Statistical bounds are given to bound the estimated flows from the wasserstein flow.  

Reviewers have raised concerns regarding the assumptions under which results present in the paper hold, this was clarified by the authors (goedesic lambda convexity, log sobolev constant for the target density . lipchitizity of velocity fields).  The paper needs a revision to incorporate that feedback and to be in shape for publication. 

Other concern were on earlier claims in the paper regarding the monge ampere equation and approximation of the optimal mapping this was addressed by the rebuttal. 

Other concerns were also on explaining the relation of the work to score based models and energy based models. 

Overall the paper needs to state in a clearer way the assumptions for the theoretical results and to acknowledge the limitations of those assumptions in analyzing the euler scheme.

This work defines the new problem of lifelong few-shot language learning where the goal is to continually learn new few-shot tasks and use those to benefit future tasks while not forgetting previous tasks. With larger models, this is an important goal due to the cost of updating and retraining these models. The work also shows superiority to existing approaches like EWC and MAS. After the author's rebuttal, the experimental section is also thorough with evaluation on a good range of tasks and approaches such as adapters showing good results. While this setting appears simpler than the full lifelong-learning setting and the approach combines existing ideas, this work's contribution to the definition and thinking about this problem is valuable. However, the authors should more clearly state the advantages of their approach vs standard prompt tuning (with an emphasis of benefiting future tasks) since two reviewers seem caught up on this point. The other two reviewers comments were addressed by the rebuttal as they stated in their comments.

This work is clear, very original, however it lacks a bit of significance and is more of a proof of concept. Here are the pros and cons I've identified.

Pros :
- This work deals with physics-based deep learning which is a very recent subject and one of growing interest for the medical community.
- Results on simulated data look promising.
- The theoretical part and the implementation is clear, too bad the code is not shared.

Cons :
- The responses to the reviewers are very dense, often repeat the same explanations from one reviewer to another and lack relevance. It is not clear what has been changed in the manuscript in particular.
- The proof of concept should have been to support in the claims of the authors, as well as the use of simulated data in the title as suggested by the last reviewer
- In order to make the work more robust and quantitative, different physical models could have been considered, different Resnet architectures and an application to real data.

This work is extremely interesting but still a little immature. So I suggest an acceptation as a poster.

DictFormer is a method to reduce the redundancy in transformers so they can deployed on edge devices. In the method, a shared dictionary across layers and unshared coefficients are used in place of weight multiplications. The author proposed a l1 relaxation to train the non-differentiable objective  to achieve both higher performance and lower parameter counts.

All reviewers ended up giving the paper a score of 6 after increasing their scores during discussions. While the results are strong (better performance at much lower parameter counts), the paper is not clearly written. Several reviewers noted that the paper is difficult to understand and has a few unresolved points. For example, the method also ended up performing better than the base transformer model that DictFormer is supposed to compress. There seems to be a lack of understanding about what part of the model delivered the improvements. One reviewer said that this is potentially a great paper that deserves to be better explained. The basic concept of sharing a dictionary across layers should be simple enough to explain well and deserve a better explanation than eq 5. 

The authors promise to release the code, which would be necessary for a full dissemination of this work. I recommend accept.

Meta Review: This work proposes a data poisoning attack for off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods. It also shows that several popular OPE methods are not robust to data poisoning attacks. The reviewers were all positive on this work, recommending strong accept, accept, accept, and weak accept. They praised the generality of the proposed problem and framework.

One main criticism that arose in several of the reviews was a lack of a stronger baseline comparator. In their response, the authors pointed out the challenge of identifying a suitable baseline, given a lack of previous work in data poisoning for off-policy evaluation. In an attempt to provide a suitable baseline, they developed their own comparator, namely a variant of the Fast Gradient Sign Method. They then showed that their main proposed framework outperforms this comparator. In my view, this response adequately addressed this reviewer critique.

The reviewers also made a number of other relatively minor comments and suggestions, and the authors addressed these in their replies.

This paper presents a new graph neural network layer that is sensitive to topological structure in the graph. Reviewers all believe the work is technically sound, and the experiments (particularly after author revisions) show clear benefits in cases where topological structure is important. The main questions are about whether the experimental evaluation is sufficient. While there are always more experiments that could be run, I tend to agree with the authors that the chosen experiments support the key claims in the paper, so it seems ok. The other question about the experiments is if they sufficiently convince the reader that topological structure is useful in practice. This seems more mixed. The paper would certainly be improved if there was a motivating application where there was a clear win. For example, molecular structures are used as motivation in the intro, but the best performing method on proteins doesn’t use the topological layer. All-in-all, though, there does appear to be clear improvements on carefully constructed cases, and there appear to be some benefits in real-world datasets.

It incorporates a denoising component based on graph wavelet transforms. The proposed method can outperform baseline methods on graph classification and social recommendation. The experimental results are very limited. The baseline methods are not well established. There are far better results on these datasets such as GIN. The writing and organization of this paper is good.

The covered topic is timely and of potential impact for many application domains, such as drug design. The paper is well written and presentation is clear. The proposed approach seems to have some degree of originality. Experimental results seem to be generally good, and in the rebuttal the authors have provided further experimental support to their main claim.  There are however some issues that have not been solved by the author’s rebuttal. I think two of them are the most important and related: 

i) significance of contribution: although the authors have tried in the rebuttal to explain how the proposed approach differs from related papers, it seems that there are still doubts about the amount of innovation introduced by the paper. This issue could have been mitigated by SOTA experimental results in presence of a proper model selection, that, however does not seem to be the case here (see next point);

ii) model selection: the authors did not clearly explain the model selection procedure in the rebuttal. This is an important issue since it is often easy to get good results by picking the best run a posteriori. Unfortunately in the literature there are highly cited papers where model selection is not performed in a proper way and reviewers very often reject papers just looking at numbers without looking at how the numbers were obtained. So, I believe it is important to accept only papers where model selection is properly done and properly explained, so to allow for reproducibility of experiments.

The authors propose a novel method, called Consensus, to study the interpretability of models, when ground truth of interpretations is not available. The proposed method consists of three stages: forming a committee of deep models, aggregating the results in “quasi ground-truth”, and ranking models based on the similarity with the quasi ground- truth. The approach is evaluated for image classification on ImageNet and CUB-200-2011.

The reviewers all found that the Consensus method introduced seemed sensible and applauded the authors on their extensive experiments.  However, clearly they struggled to understand the paper well and asked for a clearer and more formal definition of the methods introduced.  Unfortunately, the highest scoring review was also the shortest and also indicated issues with clarity.  It seems like the authors have gone a long way to improve the notation, organization and clarity of the paper, but ultimately the reviewers didn't think it was ready for acceptance.  Hopefully the feedback from the reviewers will help to improve the paper for a future submission.

Paper addresses few-shot learning in a combination of episodic meta-learning-based and pre-train finetune-based approach. It proposes meta-dropout, that consists in using dropout on training the base classes during meta-training, but not when tuning on novel classes. Extensive results on several benchmark like PascalVOC, COCO, CUB and mini-ImageNet validate the proposed approach. Although the experiments are widely validated on several benchmarks, the comparison of the experiments miss several State-of-the-art paper results.

VPR automatically detects expected and unexpected changes at each level of the latent hierarchy, which it uses to “route” bottom-up and top-down signals. Compared to a baseline method (VTA), VPR detects changes in synthetic datasets with high accuracy. The paper includes some interesting experiments to support the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Thanks for your submission to ICLR.

This paper considers a variational inference hierarchical model called Variational Predictive Routing.

Prior to discussion, several reviewers were on the fence about the paper, most notably having concerns about some of the experimental results as well as various clarity issues throughout the paper.  However, the authors did a really nice job addressing many of these concerns.  Ultimately, several of the reviewers updated their scores, leading to a clear consensus view that this paper is ready for publication.  We really appreciate your effort in providing additional details and results.

Please do keep in mind the concerns of the reviewers when preparing a final version of the manuscript.

In this work, the authors investigate the generative and denoising capabilities of the Diffusion-based Deep Generative Models (DDGMs) They claim that a DDGM is a combination of two parts. The first one generates noisy samples from the pure noise by inputting more signal from a learned data distribution. The second one removes the remaining noise from the signal. The proposed DAED seems to have performance on par with DDG Ms for most setups.

The paper analyzes diffusion-based deep generative models (DDGMs). The paper postulates that a DDGMs can be divided into two parts, a denoiser and a generator. 

After the rebuttal and discussion period, three out of four reviewers supported acceptance of the paper. The reviewers aLmZ, QKfo, and 4jY9 all find the interpretation of a diffusion-based deep generative model as a decomposition of a generator and denoising part interesting. Those reviewers also note that this interpretation is useful as parts of the diffusion steps can potentially be replaced with a VAE, which would make the synthesis more efficient.

The reviewers aLmZ and QKFo also note that one comparison is perhaps slightly unfair in that the number of parameters of the two models considered was different; the authors cleared this up with new simulations showing that matching the number of parameters (as should be done for a better comparison) does not substantially change the conclusions of the experiment. 

Finally, reviewer s9uB finds the approach and observations not to be novel and states that similar observations have been made in a recent CVPR paper by Benny and Wolf. While both the paper by Benny and Wolf and the paper under review study denoising diffusion models, the approaches taken by the two papers are substantially different, and both provide value to the community.

I also find the interpretation of the DDGMs as a denoiser and generator to be interesting and useful and therefore recommend acceptance of the paper.

The paper presents Symbolic Reward Machines (SRM) which helps in achieving interpretable and explainable reward functions. The paper also proposes a hierarchical Bayesian framework to concretize SRM using expert demonstrations. The authors adopt a Bayesian deep learning approach to simultaneously learn a reward approximator, a distribution over the parameters of the reward machine, and the policy to optimize the most-likely reward instance. They demonstrate that the inferred RM outperforms standard reward definition using standard RL approaches.

The paper proposes a framework of Symbolic Reward Machine (SRM), an extension of Reward Machine (RM), for specifying interpretable and explainable reward functions. Then, a Bayesian IRL method is proposed to concretize an SRM using expert demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SRMs in terms of training efficiency and generalization. The reviewers acknowledged that the problem of inferring symbolic rewards is important and that the proposed SRM framework is an important step in this direction. However, the reviewers pointed out several weaknesses in the paper and shared concerns, including (a) limited comparison with alternate approaches to tackle the problem and positioning w.r.t. the existing literature; (b) the domains seem rather simple since they require only a few demonstrations (implying that the holes being inferred might be quite small); (c) the novelty and theory around the SRM representation is not fully clear. I want to thank the authors for their detailed responses. Based on the reviewers’ concerns and follow-up discussions, there was a consensus that the work is not ready for publication. The reviewers have provided detailed feedback to the authors. We hope that the authors can incorporate this feedback when preparing future revisions of the paper.

This paper proposes a method for neural architecture search (NAS) based on adversarial methods. It uses a discriminator trained to distinguish between random vs. good architectures, letting the discriminator's scores serve as a reward signal for an autoregressive generator. I agree with AR1: this is a nice and clever idea. Reviewers generally agreed that the method was interesting, e.g. it's quite flexible in that it's able to incorporate constraints, and that the evaluation is rather extensive and shows that the method performs well across the board. Many minor criticisms were raised and addressed well by the authors in their responses and manuscript updates.

The major criticism shared by most reviewers was the high methodological complexity of the proposed approach, and the proportionally small gains shown over much simpler baselines. This criticism remained despite the authors' responses. The method is indeed complex: the same method without any adversarial component already performs well, and many important details of the model are relegated to Appendix A.2. (I would recommend, for example, moving Fig. 2 to the main text if at all possible. Also, the Appendix can/should be included in the main PDF for ICLR, rather than in supplementary material, as AR1 mentions.) It was not clear to reviewers that the adversarial component of the approach has a significant benefit. The authors respond by pointing to Table 7 showing that the discriminator reduces the number of queries and points out that in reality these queries correspond to expensive evaluations. If this is a major selling point of the method (it sounds like it could be), it should be highlighted and analyzed far more -- at least moved to the main text rather than an Appendix -- ideally with a real-world evaluation showing a practical large improvement in overall wall-clock time, rather than a benchmark where these evaluations are free. Perhaps the exclusive reliance on these benchmarks, though undoubtedly useful for quick experimentation, in the end holds back the paper and prevents the method's benefits from becoming apparent to the readers.

As a minor point (also raised by AR1), the paper is formatted incorrectly for ICLR: the font color is off, and more importantly the PDF is unsearchable (text cannot be selected, ctrl-F does not work), which makes it very difficult to quickly reference and review. Please try not to stray from the conference-provided style file for future submissions.

I appreciate the cleverness of the method, the extent of the evaluation, and the thorough responses to the reviews. However, unfortunately with the current presentation, it is too difficult to discern the benefit of the proposed approach from the manuscript. The approach is nonetheless intuitively appealing and seems quite promising, and I hope the authors will take the reviewers' good feedback into account and resubmit the paper in the future.

The paper presents a decision-tree approach for clustering plan traces and delineate them using linear temporal logic.

Both reviewers agree that the paper is well-written, it tackles a very interesting problem, and the technical methodology is sound. However, the reviewers also indicate two major problems with the paper: 1) the connection to XAIP is unclear; and 2) the work appears to be preliminary and incremental. Generally, the paper’s topic concerns plan summarization, which falls within the umbrella of XAIP, and a preliminary/incremental work is within the scopes of a workshop program. As such, in light of keeping the workshop a fruitful venue for discussion and dissemination of information, I am recommending accepting the paper.

Nonetheless, we urge to authors to reflect on the reviewer’s comments and address them in their revised version of the paper. Specifically, we hope the authors make a clear connection of their method to XAIP. Additionally, as the proposed approach builds heavily on the BayesLTL framework, the authors should include an overview of that framework and also explain the novelty of their approach compared to BayesLTL.

The paper deals with accelerated methods on Riemannian manifolds. A particular challenge that the paper tries to address, which the AC believes is important, is related to the bounding of the iterates. The paper starts with an explicit bounding constraint on the manifold (and relaxes to the ball constraint for certain manifolds) and shows that the proposed algorithm can respect that while achieving acceleration. The reviewers including this AC see the merits of the paper. However, the paper in its current form is far from complete. A particular concern is on the empirical performance of the algorithm, resolving which should strengthen the paper. I would encourage the authors to build on the discussions and polish the paper accordingly.

Even though the paper has positive scores, the paper in its current form is a borderline paper with significant scope for improvement. To this end, the AC cannot accept the paper.

While the proposed architecture is rather closely related to existing work, it is still interesting, as recognized by reviewers. Authors's substantial rewrites has also helped make the paper clearer. However, the empirical merits of the approach are still a bit limited; when combined with the narrow novelty compared to existing work, this makes the overall contribution a bit too thin for ICLR. Authors are encouraged to strengthen their work by showing more convincing practical benefit of their approach.

This proposal introduces CylesGym, the first Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmark targeted at long horizon decision making in agriculture. Crucially, while prior work addresses single-year decision making, CylesGym captures the long term effects that one year's crop has on future generations. 

The benchmark is clearly highly relevant and opens up a new frontier for RL researchers, making it a valuable contribution to the field. Furthermore, the benchmark does a good job of highlighting interesting opportunities for RL method development, such as costly information gathering, and evaluating current algorithms compared to baselines. 

There was an active discussion between the reviewers and authors of the benchmark which resolved the majority of issues raised in the initial reviews. As a result there is broad support across the reviewers for the paper. A lingering concern is the sim-to-real gap which is mentioned at a number of places in the paper but could be emphasised more. 

Lastly, the paper is well written and the evaluation sound. I believe this benchmark will be welcome by the community but I recommend that the authors address the concerns regarding the writing raised by  Reviewer MEYG, in particular regarding the utility for the agriculture community. In general I do not believe that issues which can be addressed in writing should be a reason to reject but those concerns should be addressed for the final version.

The authors conduct experiments with the BERT model and two fMRI datasets and show that including linguistic structure can improve brain decoding performance.

This paper explores the effect on decoding accuracy (predicting hidden representations from fMRI datasets) from fine tuning models by injecting structural bias.  This paper specifically focuses the attention of BERT on syntactic features of the text, which (for one dataset) appears to improve the decoding performance.  The paper's motivation is strong, and complex concepts are communicated clearly.

The review period was very productive.  There were some questions about analyses, and the validity of the statistical tests, but through some very thorough back and forth with the reviewers, this seems to have been resolved.  There is a good amount of analysis done on the resulting language models to try and determine the impact of finetuning or attention on the models. However, the results on the fMRI two datasets appear to be very different, and it's unclear why (and isn't clearly related back to the extensive language model analyses).  We would have liked to have seen a more thorough analysis of the stark difference in performance, and some convincing explanations for the difference based on the analyses.  


P.s. A minor point, but the Wehbe paper uses Chapter 9 of Harry potter, not chapter 2.

This paper proposes an extension of CTC by considering the wild-card to adjust the label missing issues during training. The authors propose to minimize the loss over all possible sub-segments of the input to automatically align the one that matches the available transcript. It is empirically proved to significantly improve performance over CTC even if up to 40-70% label sequence is missed (overall performance similar to the complete label case) across different tasks. 

As agreed by the reviewers, the paper is well presented and the problem is interesting to a broad community. Dynamic time warping with unconstrained endpoints itself is not a new idea and a classical topic for speech recognition (e.g. word spotting). The contribution of the paper is the formal introduction of the approach to CTC and to give experimental results to confirm the effectiveness. Also the use of simulated data weakens the paper a bit.

The decision is mainly based on the clear presentation and fair experimental justification.

This paper is a computational linguistic study of the semantics that can be inferred form text corpora given parsers (which are trained on human data) are used to infer the verbs and their objects in text. The reviewers agreed that the work was well executed, and that the experiments comparing the resulting representations to human data were solid. The method employed has little or no technical novelty (in my opinion, not necessarily a flaw), and it's not clear what tasks (beyond capturing human data) representations could be applied to (again, not a problem if the goal is to develop theories of cognition). 

The first draft of the work missed important connections to the computational linguistics literature, where learning about 'affordances for verbs' (referred to as 'selectional preferences') has long been an important goal. The authors did a good job of setting out these connections in the revised manuscript, which the reviewers appreciated. 

The work is well executed, and should be commended for relating ideas from different sub-fields in its motivation and framing. But my sincere view is that it does not meet the same standards of machine-learning or technical novelty met by other papers at this conference. It is unclear to me what the framing in terms of 'affordance' adds to a large body of literature studying the semantics of word embeddings, given various syntactically and semantically-informed innovations.  It feels to me like this work would have been an important contribution to the literature in 2013, but given the current state of the art in representation learning from text and jointly learning from text and other modalities, I would like to have seen some attempt to incorporate these techniques and bridge the gap between the notion of affordance in text/verbs (selectional preference) and Gibson's notion of object affordance (what you can do physically with an object) in experiments and modelling, not just in the discussion. Such a programme of research could yield fascinating insights into the nature of grounding, and the continuum from the concrete, which can be perceived and directly experienced, to the abstract, which must be learned from text. I encourage the authors to continue in this direction. An alternative is to consider submitting the current manuscript to venue where the primary focus is cognitive modelling, and accounting for human, behavioural data, and where there is less emphasis on the development of novel methods or models.

For these reasons, and considering the technical scope of related papers in the programme, I cannot fairly recommend acceptance in this case.

In the context of recurrent neural networks, the motivation of the paper is to explore the "space" between fully trained models and almost not trained models, e.g. echo state networks, using a formal approach. In fact, a modular approach has proven to be very successful in many practical applications, and in addition brain seems to adopt this strategy as well. The addressed theoretical issue is stability of the network (i.e., the network implements a contraction map.) Specifically, it is assumed that a network is composed of a set of subnetworks that meet by construction some stability condition, and the problem is to design a mixing weight matrix, interconnecting the latent spaces of the subnetworks, able to give stability guarantees during and after training. Some novel stability conditions are proposed as well as two different approaches to design a successful mixing weight matrix. The original submitted paper was not easy to read, and after revision major problems with presentation have been resolved, although the current version looks more like an ordered collection of results/statements than a smooth and integrated flow of discourse. The revision has also addressed some concerns by reviewers on the role of size and sparsity of the modules, as well as the sensitivity of the stabilization condition on the mixing weight matrix has been experimentally assessed, obtaining interesting results. Overall the paper reports interesting results, however the novelty of the contribution seems to be a bit weak, e.g. stability conditions on recurrent networks (although different from the reported ones) were already presented in literature. Also the idea of exploiting, in one of the proposed models,  the fact that the matrix exponential of a skew-symmetric matrix is orthogonal to maintain the convergence condition during training, is not novel. Moreover, the experimental assessment does not provide a direct comparison, under the same architectural/learning setting, of the novel stability results versus the ones already presented in literature. Empirical results are obtained on simple tasks (using datasets with sequences of identical length), and relatively small networks, which limits a bit the scope of the assessment, as well as it is not clear if the observed improvements (where obtained) are statistically significant (especially when compared with results obtained by networks with the same order of parameters.) The quality of the assessment would increase significantly by considering datasets with sequences of different lengths, and involving more challenging tasks that do require larger networks.

Concept bottleneck models implicitly learn to explain the downstream tasks in addition to learning how to perform them. Authors propose Concept Embedding Models (CEMs) that address this issue. CEM contains an embedding generator layer that considers two embedding representations (one for activate and one for inactivate) and then produces a representation for one concept. Results show that the model produces high task accuracy and interpretable at the same time compared to CBMs.

Generated Summary 475:
The paper proposes the novel idea of using contingency awareness to aid exploration in sparse-reward reinforcement learning tasks. The core idea is to identify controllable (learned) features of the state, which in an Atari game typically corresponds to the position of the player-controlled character. Once this position is known, one can use existing count-based exploration mechanisms to encourage the agent to visit new positions. This approach has clear advantages to earlier proposed count based techniques. The choice of extra loss functions is not very well motivated.
Gold Metareview 475:
The paper addresses the challenging and important problem of exploration in sparse-rewards settings. The authors propose a novel use of contingency awareness, i.e., the agent's understanding of the environment features that are under its direct control, in combination with a count-based approach to exploration. The model is trained using an inverse dynamics model and attention mechanism and is shown to be able to identify the controllable character. The resulting exploration approach achieves strong empirical results compared to alternative count-based exploration techniques. The reviewers note that the novel approach has potential for opening up potential fruitful directions for follow-up research. The obtained strong empirical results are another strong indication of the value of the proposed idea.


The reviewers mention several potential weaknesses. First, while the proposed idea is general, the specific implementation seems targetted specifically towards Atari games. While Atari is a popular benchmark domain, this raises questions as to whether insights can be more generally applied. Second, several questions were raised regarding the motivation for some of the presented modeling choices (e.g., loss terms) as well as their impact on the empirical results. Ablation studies were recommended as a step to resolving these questions Reviewer 3 questioned whether the learned state representation could be directly used as an additional input to the agent, and if it would improve performance. Finally, several related works were suggested that should be included in the discussion of related work.

The authors carefully addressed the issues raised by the reviewers, running additional comparisons and adding to the original empirical insights. Several issues of clarity were resolved in the paper and in the discussion. Reviewer 3 engaged with the authors and confirmed that they are satisfied with the resulting submission. The AC judges that the suggestions of reviewer 1 have been addressed to a satisfactory level. A remaining issue regarding results reporting was raised anonymously towards the end of the review period, and the AC encourages the authors to address this issue in their camera ready version.

The formulation of the energy-based model is theoretically akin to the minimum conjugate entropy objective. With practical function approximation, the proposed algorithm according to the theory was shown achieving superior performance.

This paper proposes a novel method for variational inference based on Wasserstein flows. The key contribution is perhaps the rigorous guarantees that are derived from an assumption of log-concavity. While the initial submission was unaware of some existing work on VI that derives guarantees from similar log concavity or smoothness assumptions, the proof strategy that is given uses novel technical methods, and thus is of interest in any case. Readers would benefit from a detailed discussion that can contextualize this work to previous work, which the authors have committed to doing.

The paper proposes a GNN-based method for objective space decomposition (ODA) in IP problems. The method is strictly designed for the ODA approach to be solved, which allows it to gains the performance improvements, but does perhaps not leave much room for further generalization. The proposed GNN model takes the instance information (decision variables, constraints, and objectives) as input, and then adaptively discards local upper bounds (to update the search region) without calling an IP solver.

This paper proposes an algorithm for achieving disentangled representations by encouraging low mutual information between features at each layer, rather than only at the encoder output, and proposes a neural architecture for learning. Empirically, the proposed method achieves good disentanglement metric and likelihood (reconstruction error) in comparison to prior methods. The reviewers think that the methodology is natural and novel to their knowledge, and are happy with the detailed execution.

Gold Metareview 481:
Strengths:
Paper uses an efficient inference procedure cutting inference time on intermediate frames by 53%, & yields better accuracy and IOU compared to the one recent closely related work.

The ablation study seems sufficient and well-designed. The paper presents two feature propagation strategies and three feature fusion methods. The experiments compare these different settings, and show that interpolation-BMV is indeed a better feature propagation.

Weaknesses: Reviewers believed the work to be of limited novelty. The algorithm is close to the optical-flow based models Shelhamer et al. (2016) and Zhu et al. (2017). Reviewer asserts that the main difference is that the optical-flow is replaced with BMV, which is a byproduct of modern cameras.  R3 felt that there was Insufficient experimental comparison with other baselines and that technical details were not clear enough.

Contention: Authors assert that Shelhamer et al. (2016) does not use optical flow, and instead simply copies features from frame to frame (and schedules this copying). Zhu et al. (2017) then proposes an improvement to this scheme, forward feature warping with optical flow. In general, both these techniques fail to achieve speedups beyond small multiples of the baseline (< 3x), without impacting accuracy.

Consensus: It was disappointing that some of the reviewers did not engage after the author review (perhaps initial impressions were just too low). However, after the author rebuttal R1 did respond and held to the position that the work should not be accepted, justified by the assertion that other modern architectures that are lighter weight and are able to produce fast predictions.

This paper is truly borderline. On one hand, the theoretical contribution seems novel and interesting, however, there appears to be somewhat of a gap between theory and practice. 

There is unfortunately another problem. According to the authors, the main contribution of this publication is arguably the introduction of the nearest neighbor as the positive example in the triplet loss. However, the authors seem to be unaware of the history of the triplet loss. It was originally introduced by Schultz & Joachims 2004 as a loss over all triplets.  Weinberger et al. 2005 changed it and use the nearest neighbor as "target neighbor", which is called "easy positives" here, as the objective of LMNN. In 2009 Chechik et al. subsequently relaxed this positive neighbor formulation to any similarly labeled sample (going back to the Schultz & Joachims formulation) but sampling triplets. The re-introduction of the nearest neighbor as "easy positive" was then covered by Xuan et al. 2020.  

Unfortunately all of this diminishes the novelty significantly and it is clear that the paper in its current form does not have a strong enough contribution. I do encourage the authors to take a close look at the original LMNN publication and Xuan et al and write an improved re-submission for the next conference that maybe focuses more on the theoretical contribution. 
Good luck,

The paper in its most recent version claims that deep neural networks, when very carefully regularized, outperform methods such as Gradient Boosting Trees on tabular data. This is genuinely surprising to me (in a good way), and I suppose it is as well to the community.

The paper initially received negative reviews with two key remarks that "The results are somewhat expected." (R4, R3, R2). Indeed, the original version mainly stated that very careful regularization helps on tabular data.  Naturally, the reviewers (including myself) seen then as the second key weakness that "All experiments are run on tabular data." (R4, R3).

Based on the reviews, the Authors have clarified and changed their message. I think it is well summarized by R2 "The paper has been significantly refocused and now sells itself as a way of deep neural networks being competitive versus gradient boosting methods, which are dominating the tabular heterogeneous tasks."

As R2 said and was reflected in comments by other reviewers, "[...] convinced by authors response on paper novelty, technical contribution and (after the re-focusing) potential usefulness to the community".

Given the new message of the paper, a key new question surfaces. Is this indeed the first convincing demonstration that deep learning can outperform more standard methods on tabular data? R2 pointed out TabNet (see also Google Cloud offering) that already in 2019 claimed "beating GB methods for the tabular data". There is also NeurIPS work "Regularization Learning Networks: Deep Learning
for Tabular Datasets"; their abstract opens with "Despite their impressive performance, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) typically underperform Gradient Boosting Trees (GBTs) on many tabular-dataset learning tasks. We propose that applying a different regularization coefficient to each weight might boost the performance of DNNs by allowing them to make more use
of the more relevant inputs". The latter work did not claim to beat GBT. Regardless, the two works should be carefully discussed and compared empirically to in the new version of the work. 

I am also not yet fully convinced by the added comparison to GDBT. Arguably, AutoML from the sklearn package is not the most popular way to use GDBT in practice. How would regularization cocktails compare to GDBT from XGBoost, optimized using either random search or bayesian optimization?

Based on the above, I have to recommend the rejection of the paper. The key reason is: *the new reframing of the paper is exciting but warrants a much more detailed and careful evaluation*.

I really appreciate the work the Authors have put in clarifying and changing the message of the paper. I understand this is disappointing that we won't be able to include the work in ICLR. Nevertheless, I hope that the Authors found the feedback useful, and wanted to thank the Authors for submitting the work for consideration in ICLR.

The framework assumes the presence of an oracle that can give us the true compositional structure. The experiments seem to be fairly similar kinds of composition with very few attributes (mostly bigrams) missing.

I'm also somewhat concerned at R2's mention of a potential confound in one experiment. The paper has been updated with what appears to be a fix, though, and R2 has not yet responded, so I'm presuming that this issue has been resolved.

I also ask the authors to release code shortly upon de-anonymization, as promised.

This paper presents a general MCMC algorithm for approximating the joint posterior distribution of model parameters and true/denoised data, given a corrupted data set. The paper also states the $O(n)$ time complexity of this step and presents a derivation of MCMC's ergodicity in this context. In this paper, authors propose a method for noise-aware statistical inference under DP. The aim is to enable Bayesian inference that can capture the DP induced noise. The proposed Metropolis within Gibbs sampler targets asymptotically the correct distribution.

This paper presents a general MCMC algorithm for approximating the joint posterior distribution of model parameters and private data, given output from a differentially private algorithm. The paper provides new tools for Bayesian inference under privacy constraints, which can be useful for the differential privacy community. There are a few suggestions from the reviewers/discussion. First, even though the authors claimed their results are fully general, they should consider toning it down or at least clarifying upfront their "Record Additivity" assumption, which seems non-trivial. As one of the reviewers remarked, one of the limitations of this approach is that it will not scale well with high-dimensional data. The AC suggests the authors add this limitation in the discussion of the paper.

Other comments:
While not critical, the AC also has a question regarding the following part:
- In line 105: the assumption is that the density of the mechanism's output distribution is known. This has nothing to do with what privacy variant you use to analyze the mechanism.

This paper studies how the preprocessed data can be reused as auxiliary tasks in primary multi-task learning (MTL) for the multimodal emotion detection task. Two different hierarchical-level models, FLAT-MTL hierarchical attention model and HAN-Rock model, are proposed. The paper is well written and easy to follow. It is motivated by the analysis of video-conferencing videos which is indeed a crucial and topical issue.

The initial reviews for this paper were very borderline. The authors provided detailed responses as well as a few additional results and observations. The authors' responses answered the reviewers' questions and addressed their main comments (including in the discussion of related works as well as with more in-depth analysis in a new Section 5.1). Unfortunately, the reviewers did not come to a consensus.

Overall, this paper extends some current methodology for emotional classification, is well-executed, and provides a reasonably thorough study. The results are somewhat in line with previous results from other fields (and notably NLP), but the authors demonstrate the efficacy of using primary multi-task learning for multimodal conversational analysis. 

Unfortunately, this paper also has some flaws as highlighted by the initial reviews. As stated above, the authors did provide a strong rebuttal, but given the different comments raised by the reviewers that spanned many aspects of the paper including motivation, possibly limited contribution and novelty, missing related work, somewhat shallow analysis of the results, I find that another full round of reviewing would be useful to assess the paper.

As a result, this remains a very borderline paper, and given the strong competition at this year's conference, I cannot recommend acceptance at this stage.

I suggest that the authors incorporate some of the discussions from this forum (and especially with respect to related work, new findings, and clearly defining the motivation and contribution of this work) into the next version of their paper.

MorphTE is a new word embedding compression method with morphological augmentation. The authors conduct experiments on machine translation, question answering, and natural language inference tasks. This is important research that mixes pre-existing knowledge and corpus-derived knowledge. The paper fails to be clear with respect to the use of the tensor product. It is unclear how this model generalizes. The method is well motivated and performs well on machine translations.

The paper presents a method to compress word embeddings using morphologically-enhanced tensorized embeddings. The main idea is decomposing a word embedding into a tensor product of multiple small vectors. This idea has been explored in previous work [1], the main contribution of this is using *morphological segmentation*, aiming to capture morphological features. 

The proposed method is compared to prior work on multiple tasks (machine translation, qeustion answering, etc), overall exhibiting strong performance in terms of compression rate & performance (though sometimes gains are pretty smaller compared to Word2ket (e.g., Table 2)). 

During the discussion phase, the authors provided the results with random, non-morpholgically inspired segmenation, which was useful. I’d recommend putting them into the main paper. Experimenting on morphologically rich languages (e.g., Finnish) would be useful. As well as sensitive study towards hyper parameters (e.g., dimensionality of morpheme embeddings) which can easily impact the compression rate & performance. 

Overall, the reviewers and AC is positive about the paper.

The paper proposes combining two orthogonal algorithms -- the lazily aggregated gradient(LAQ)method and adaptive quantization (AdaQuantFL)-- to reduce communication complexity in federated learning. At the heart of the combining strategy is Eq. 7, which allocates the bits used in each iteration. The idea of adaptation of quantization and frequency of communications is very nice; however the broadcasting procedure seems to be very time-consuming.

Two of the initial reviews of the paper were mildly positive (2 scores of 6), and one was very positive (score of 8). However, these reviews failed to notice some severe issues with the paper, which were detailed by the Area Chair in an Extra Review which was provided late. The severe issues include: clarity of exposition (undefined notation in many places) and theory (vacuous or meaningless theorems and assumptions). I apologize to the authors for not having had the chance to defend against this late review. However, the issues are indeed severe.

The paper proposed Trained ML oracles to find the decent direction and step size in optimization. The process they call grafting. Reviewers raised several concerns about the reliability of ML oracles in general settings which is valid. The rebuttal could not convince the reviewers to change their opinion.  Ideally for an empirical only paper with heavy reliability on ML for critical decisions, to meet the high bar of ICLR there must be several experiments (5-10 datasets or more) on diverse datasets and settings. Also, there should be discussions on when and how the method fails and related discussions. In that sense the paper does not meet the bar for publication.

The work describes the use of RL for trajectory planning for minimally invasive liver tumor ablation. The main motivation is that RL can accelerate planning over conventional methods.

Strengths according to reviewers:
* Interesting problem.
* Relatively well written.
* Good description of RL methodology. 
* Interesting results (comparable performance to conventional method, faster inference)
* Uses public database, which may facilitate reproducibility and comparisons in future work.


Weaknesses:
* Limited novelty with respect to machine learning. Main contribution is rather the idea of using RL to improve the specific application.
* Not extensive evaluation.

Initial reviewer concerns regarding weak motivation and clarity were addressed to a significant extent, improving the manuscript, which is reflected to the increased ratings after rebuttal. 

After a very productive rebuttal and discussion period, accompanied with significant updates to the paper, there seems to be a concensus that the paper is of acceptable quality for a publication in MIDL.

They randomly choose the centers to vary over classifiers, and impose the I-covariance matrices to be dissimilar.

The paper proposes a method to improve adversarial robustness by diversifying the ensemble. 

Novelty: As pointed out by several reviewers, promoting diversity of ensembles has been done in the literature, but there's still a moderate novelty in proposing the DML layer. 

Empirical validations: The original submission lacks many important comparisons (e.g., with [1]). Despite the authors implicitly compared their method with (Pang et al) via Auto-attack in the rebuttal, it will be better if the comparisons are conducted in a well-controlled way to confirm that the improved robustness comes from DML instead of other hyperparameter settings. Further, it is not clear whether the proposed method is robust to hyperparameters. 

Based on these, we recommend rejection but encourage the authors to improve their paper based on the comments.

Meta Review: In this paper, the authors revisit recent work (Lee et al., 2019) on identification of interventional distributions from a set that may include the observed data distribution and/or a set of interventional distributions.  (Lee et al., 2019) proposed a sound and complete identification algorithm for that problem.  The authors point out a critical flaw in that work: the completeness proof relies in a crucial way on absence of positivity.  However, absence of positivity (even including relaxations of positivity proposed by Shpitser and Pearl) results in the proposed algorithm not being sound, as the authors convincingly illustrate with examples.  The authors provide a repair of the algorithm proposed by (Lee et al., 2019), with new soundness and completeness proofs.

The reviewers were unanimously positive about this paper, and their questions were answered by the authors to their satisfaction.  Some reviewers pointed out that in addition to repairing a critical flaw in a recent paper, this work will also encourage authors in the causal graphical modeling community to pay more careful attention to important issues related to positivity or "overlap" assumptions.

This paper considers the following problem in distributed optimization: To train an overparameterized model over a set of distributed nodes, what is the minimum number of bits required to reach zero loss. The paper gives lower bounds on the bit complexity for two settings: non-convex functions satisfying a PL condition and overparameterized quadratics. The authors then give an algorithm that (1) for PL objectives, has optimal communication complexity (up to logarithmic terms in the dimension of the problem) and (2) for quadratic overparameterized objectives, attains optimal communication complexity (up to logarithmic terms) with high probability.

This paper generated significant discussion in the initial author-reviewer discussion period. Most of the reviewers were quite positive on the paper, and found the results to be interesting and relevant to the community, and found the paper to be well-written. They found the results, which provide near-optimal sample complexity for two settings (PL functions and overparameterized quadratics) to be technically strong, and were impressed by the tightness of the results. One reviewer took issue with certain limitations of the paper, including:
- A limitation of the lower bounds in the paper is that they concern only deterministic methods.
- The results are only tight with respect to the parameters $D$, $N$, and $\epsilon$, and are not necessarily tight with respect to $L$ and $\mu$.
- Some related work can be discussed in more detail.

These limitations do not seem to take away from the novelty, and neither I nor the other reviewers were convinced by the other issues raised in the discussion. As a result, I believe the paper is worth accepting as a starting point for future research in this direction. Nonetheless, the authors are encouraged to expand the discussion around these issues and limitations in the final version of the paper, as well as expand the comparison to related work.

This paper looks at the fair ranking problem, a known variant of ranking where group fairness constraints (typically hard, sometimes soft) are imposed on the traditional ranking objective, but where membership of each item to be ranked in a group (aka the sensitive attribute's value associated with that item) is unknown.  The paper provides strong theoretical results and, especially post-rebuttal, strong experimental backing of the setting at hand.  Some assumptions are relatively strong, as surfaced by reviewers (e.g., 3sFW), but by and large reviewers believed the work to be well motivated and complete, and I agree with that.

The approach suggested fits the network before interventions, then again assigns a likelihood score to the network parameters.

Ultimately there was a general consensus amongst the reviewers that without additional theoretical results to advance the state of the art, the contribution of this work is limited.

As summarized by reviewer 5G2f, this paper proposes a novel learning-based approach to discover the modular concepts (i.e., modular structure) from raw CAD sketches. To tackle the problem, the authors first define a domain specific language (DSL) such that modular concepts can be represented in a network-friendly manner.

A Transformer-based detection module takes in a CAD sketch sequence and outputs a a set of latent embeddings, which are further decoded to parameterized modular concepts by a generation module. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end self-supervised manner, using reconstruction loss plus regularization terms.

The authors perform experiments on a large scale CAD sketch dataset and mainly demonstrate its applications for design intent interpretation (i.e., parse modular concepts from a raw CAD sketch) and auto-completion (i.e., complete a partial CAD sketch).

All reviewers recognize the novelty and contribution of this work, and the reviewer-author discussion was quite fruitful as many points, ranging from designer/user interaction, comparison to baseline methods, and issues with the library size are discussed and addressed. With such clear contribution and applicability to the CAD domain, I highly recommend the acceptance of this work.

Meta Review: The paper proposes a novel quantitative measure for risk in RL. The measure is sensitive to aleatoric and epistemic risk, and avoids some theoretical issues with previously proposed additive measures of the two types of risk. The paper also proposes a novel risk sensitive RL algorithm (based on ensemble bootstrapping and distributional RL). The method performs well empirically.

Pro:
* All reviewers agree that the proposed measure and algorithm is novel, sound, and original. 
* 3 out of 4 reviewers agree that the paper is well written. 
* The topic of risk sensitive RL is timely and important - 3 out of 4 reviewers rate the potential impact as good (3).
* Empirical results justify the theoretical claims and the method performs well compared to other distributional RL methods

Con:
* In their initial assessment, reviewers point out minor technical flaws and some difficulties in understanding parts of the empirical evaluation. The authors have commented on the issues raised, but only 1 reviewer has responded to the authors' comments.
* PeBL points out a potential shortcoming w.r.t. the training protocol (splitting the data). Authors acknowledge this and point to other papers in the literature using a similar protocol.
* The method seems somewhat complicated and could perhaps be presented better - this is based on questions raised by reviewers, and these questions should be helpful for the authors to improve the camera-ready presentation.

**Justification of recommendation:** 3 of 4 reviewers are in favor of accepting the paper. The only (weakly) negative reviewer has raised some major issues that are answered in the appendix of the paper (but the reviewer did not find the appendix) and answered in other sections of the paper (as pointed out by the authors). To me, the authors have adequately addressed all major and most minor comments in their extensive response (including the major issues raised by the negative reviewer) - unfortunately only the most positive reviewer responded to the rebuttal. Taking all this information together I can still confidently recommend acceptance of the paper.

Generated Summary 512:
This paper defines a new "safety" measure for a ML model given a good reference model. The safety metric is the maximum of outputs deviation between the target model and the reference model for some input sets. Such a measure can be efficiently computed for decision trees, generalized linear and additive models. However, the proposed approach is somewhat too restrictive to generalize to all ML models. This paper proposes to use maximum deviation, defined by the difference between a reference model and a trained model over a superset of training data.

The authors propose to inspect learned models based on their maximum deviation to a reference model. They evaluate the feasibility of computing this deviation for a number of widely used model classes, including generalised linear models and decision trees. The idea is illustrated in cases studies. 

Reviewers all appreciated the novelty and importance of the proposed problem and the contributions made to examine the feasibility of solving it. Their main concerns were regarding the limited discussion on choosing the reference model and the certification set. The authors expanded greatly on this in their rebuttal and in a revision to the paper. 

The technical novelty is rather lower but the paper should not have trouble finding an audience in the NeurIPS community due to the broad applicability of the problem under consideration the clarity of the manuscript. I think the added discussion asked for by reviewers is well within what could be expected to be added for a camera-ready version (and indeed, this is already in the Appendix of the revision).

It seems the angle typically converges to 10 to 20 degrees. I hope the authors carefully consider how to enhance this paper.

This paper presents an intriguing empirical phenomenon in deep learning. They train a variety of architectures for different tasks using different datasets and study the relationship between the learned representations. In particular they collect the representations into a large matrix and take the top left singular vector and measure the cosine of the angle. They show that it is much smaller than one might expect, about 10 degrees or so, and has an approximate monotonicity property as the network is being trained although it does not seem to converge to zero. Moreover this measure also correlates with performance. 

The reviewers had divided opinions on this paper. On the one hand, the range of experiments is impressive and truly demonstrates that this is a pervasive phenomenon. On the other hand, it is not so clear what it means. In particular, suppose we have a collection of graphs which have close to the same degree distributions. If we take the top left singular vectors of all the adjacency matrices, they would also have low angles between them. While this is a very different setting and there is no analogy between the experiments in this paper and this toy model, it does raise philosophical questions about whether the phenomenon is meaningful or is a byproduct of something else about the data. This may be a challenging question to answer, but one reviewer brought up a natural next step: One could measure the principal angle between the subspace of the top k left singular vectors across experiments for larger values of k. The authors do bring up the point that the spectrum decays very quickly, so it could be that beyond a certain point the singular vectors behave somewhat randomly.

The paper claims that a *non-uniform compression* improves the final accuracy of the pruned models on the original data and adversarially perturbed data. The strategy found is implemented on two state-of-the-art robust pruning method, HYDRA and Robust-ADMM. The empirical studies are thorough and convincing. This paper may bring insights and exhibit impact on the network pruning community. The equation between L157 and L158 is informal.

This work studies four task-agnostic metrics for evaluating reinforcement learning agents: human similarity, curiosity, empowerment and information gain. Results show that a combination of task reward and curiosity better explain human behavior. The paper as it stands, provide useful, but expected insights. The curiosity and exploration is an important topic for RL research and we need more in-depth analysis of this paper. The difficulty with the paper is that it's not clear what exactly you're after here.

Reviews were split. Reviewers agreed on the importance of the domain but differed in how they valued the contribution over ProteomeTools, which the dataset builds upon. A primary concern was lack of baselines/benchmarking. The rebuttal argues that baselines would not add much value since strong methods have been published in prior work. However, my interpretation of the reviewers ask is not to invent new heuristic baselines but to evaluate the prior methods on the newly prepared dataset. The authors do add evaluation of one such model (Prosit) to the revision. Evaluating more models in the same way could strengthen the contribution, and could be part of the ongoing maintenance of the dataset / code.

Overall, however, the majority of reviewers felt the paper does provide significant value beyond ProteomeTools and other prior work, through the new annotations, tooling, and usage recommendations. The revision adds an appendix (G) to clarify these contributions, and it may be useful to move some of that text into the intro of the paper (as I think many readers will want to know what are the main contributions beyond the base dataset). I agree with the majority that there is significant value added and recommend acceptance.

Anchor-changing Regularized Natural Policy Gradient (ARNPG) is a novel framework for designing policy- gradient based methods for multi-objective MDPs. It builds on first-order methods for convex optimization problems. In contrast to prior work, it allows convergence without artificial or impractical assumptions. Some empirical experiments corroborate theoretical results. Theoretically, the designed algorithms based on the ARNPG framework achieve $O(\frac{1}{T})$ global convergence with exact gradients.

This paper studies multi-objective RL, and in particular the settings of smooth concave scalarization, constraints, and max-min trade-off. The authors propose a framework for these problems called “anchor changing regularized natural policy gradient” (ARNPG) and show $O(1/T)$ convergence with exact gradients. The results do not require some of the assumptions used in related works such as ergodicity. The authors evaluate their approach on tabular environments, Acrobot, and (post-rebuttal) Hopper.
The paper is well-written, the results seem correct, and the work provides a nice extension of the recent results on PG convergence to the multi-objective case. This contribution warrants acceptance despite the somewhat limited empirical evaluation.

The paper presents a new evaluation dataset for machine translation, focusing on sampling test examples that can effectively rank different systems. The evaluation set contains a wide range of language pairs (35 language pairs) and shows a higher correlation with human judgments than original, unfiltered datasets. 

All reviewers agreed that the paper points out a new perspective on the MT task, and the same idea of filtering evaluation datasets to improve discrimination ability can be applied for other tasks. The paper also includes in-depth analysis, such as what kind of sentences are getting filtered, and how it connects to human paraphrasing. My initial concern about using same models to compute variance and then to evaluate output was addressed during the rebuttal period.

The paper suggests that non-adaptive attacks lead to an overstate on adversarial robustness, and thus the authors recommend using adaptive attacks as a gold-standard.

This paper explores how different strategies for fine-tuning affect in- and out-of-distribution performance. The paper theoretically analyzes the tradeoffs in a simplified scenario with two-layer networks. Their experiments on a number of datasets including CIFAR, WILDS-FMoW confirm the intuitions from their theory. This paper suggests that this occurs because fine- tuning distorts features in conjunction with the final linear layer. It is known that fine- Tuning (FT) outperforms linear probing (LP) ID.

The paper provides a solid and thorough analysis to the two basic methods of fine-tuning, linear probing (LP) and fine-tuning (FT). The authors provide an important and highly interesting observation about the performance of both in and out of domain (OOD) setting. They validate the known phenomena that FT outperforms LP in the in-domain (ID) setting, but demonstrate that when tested on OOD data, LP is in fact more performant and back this observation with a theoretical and empirical analysis.
The remedy provided is also a known, yet slightly less popular technique of setting the final layer (LP) first, then finte-tuning (FT-LP). The authors provide thorough experiments showing that this technique enjoys the best of both worlds, meaning ID and OOD. I found it worth noting that during the rebuttal period the authors provided experiments on additional larger scale datasets and models and the results of the paper carried over to these new setting.
The reviews agree that the analysis provided is both interesting and novel. Even though the paper does not provide a new technique, there is a consensus that the understanding it gives on known techniques is a welcome addition to ICLR.

The reviews are a bit mixed. While all the reviewers feel that the paper proposed an interesting mechanism to train conditional generators from a single image and demonstrated good image editing results in the experiments, there are also common concerns about the practicality of the proposed method for interactive image editing. All the reviewers asked for the computation time, and some expressed the concerns about technical contributions. While these concerns were (somewhat) addressed in the rebuttal, the AC feels that it’s a hard sell to bet on the dramatic increase of computational capacity to make the computing time from an hour to realtime. Concerns about novelty also remained. Given the drawbacks, the final decision was to not accept. However, this work is promising and can be made stronger for publication in a later venue.

The paper addresses how to learn policies for tasks in which constraints are specified in natural language. They propose a model that encodes the different types of natural language constraints into intermediate representations. Then, they use this as input along with the observation to produce an action at each time step for a safe trajectory. The proposed system is made of two parts: a constraint interpreter that is (mostly) trained in a supervised way with Amazon Mechanical Turk. And a policy that is trained through PCPO, a TRPO-like constraint-aware policy optimization algorithm.

The goal of the paper is to learn policies that can solve a given task while adhering to certain constraints specified via natural language. The paper closely builds upon prior work on constrained RL and passes the representation of natural language constraints by pre-training an interpreter. Experiments are done in a new proposed 2D grid-world benchmark. Although reviewers liked the premise, the main issue raised is that the way natural language constraints are handled is no different from the way it is done in prior work on constrained RL. The authors provided the rebuttal and addressed some of the concerns regarding paper details. However, upon discussion post rebuttal, the reviewers and AC feel that the paper does not provide clear scientific insight because the natural language part is processed separately from the policy learning part. We also believe that the paper will immensely benefit with results in more complex environments beyond the 2D grid-world. Please refer to the reviews for final feedback and suggestions to strengthen the submission.

This paper argues that one reason evaluating the strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis is difficult is the lack of ground-truth tickets. The authors note a distinction between kinds of sparse networks in the literature. "Weak tickets" require training to perform comparably to the original network, while "strong tickets" do not. The motivation and the correctness of the lottery ticket planting are not clear to me. The proposed framework is driven by theoretical analysis. The paper is not well-written and the logical flow can be improved.

Gold Metareview 527:
This paper takes on (in my view) one of the most important questions in the lottery ticket literature today: how small are the smallest lottery tickets that exist in our neural networks? Many methods have been proposed for finding weak lottery tickets (those that require training to reach full accuracy) and strong lottery tickets (those that do not), but we have no idea how close they come to finding the smallest lottery tickets. Moreover, in many cases, we only know how to find lottery ticket subnetworks early in training rather than at initialization. Is this a fundamental limitation on the existence of lottery tickets, or is this simply a limitation of our methods for finding them? I am personally very involved in lottery ticket conversations in the literature, and I believe I can speak with some authority when I say that these are vital questions where any progress is important.

Moreover, these are exceedingly difficult research questions, and (again, in my view) the authors should be commended for taking them on. A naive approach to these questions would involve brute force search over all possible subnetworks, which is infeasible even on the smallest of toy examples, let alone the meaningful computer vision tasks where lottery ticket work typically focuses.

I am sharing all of this information to provide background for my confident recommendation to accept this paper over the many legitimate concerns expressed by reviewers and those that I saw when reading the paper in detail. Those include that:
* This paper does not solve any of these research problems in their entirety.
* It focuses on toy networks smaller than those traditionally studied in the lottery ticket literature, and it is well known that lottery ticket behavior changes in character at larger scales.
* Planting good subnetworks may be an unrealistic proxy for the kinds of subnetworks that actually emerge naturally.
* There may be multiple good subnetworks in a network, not just the one that was planted.
* The graphs are a bit hard to read.
* I find the mix of pruning methods studied, which were designed with very different goals (pruning after training, pruning before training, finding strong lottery tickets), a bit confusing.

**The bottom line:** With all of that said, in my view, the paper asks good questions and provides an initial foothold that other researchers will be able to build on as we seek more general answers. This is similar to the contributions made by Zhou et al., which started the conversation on strong lottery tickets, and potentially even Frankle & Carbin, which kicked off the lottery ticket discussion but got many things wrong. Both papers were good first attempts at solving big problems, and both were highly influential despite their flaws. Similarly, even if this submission isn't perfect in every way, this is among the most important kinds of contributions that a paper can make. For that reason, I strongly recommend acceptance under the belief that this paper will help to foster a valuable conversation in the literature.

P.S. I really, truly, strongly beg the authors to redo their graphs following the style of some of the more user-friendly lottery ticket or pruning papers they have cited (e.g., Frankle et al., 2021). The graphs in this paper were really hard to parse. Really really really hard to parse. They're too small, the y-axis is often squished, gridlines would be helpful, the lines are overlapping in ways that are difficult to distinguish because the colors blend, etc. etc. This is quite possibly the biggest impediment I see to this paper's ability to have broader influence.

The authors present a graph neural network for heterophilic data using gradient flows. The proposed architecture is quite simple...large sections of the architecture are fully linear dynamical systems rather than neural networks, and still achieve roughly SotA results on standard graph learning benchmarks. There was a significant amount of disagreement between the reviewers. Some seemed to think the strength of mostly linear methods meant that the benchmarks were too easy, but these are standard graph neural network benchmarks. A simple model performing well is not a negative, and can often be useful for puncturing hype (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13211). Simple architectures can also be useful for providing analytic insights which might get obscured in more complex models. Some reviewers seemed concerned about the scaling of certain tools (e.g. graph Laplacian eigenvectors), but these tools are only used for analysis, not for training. Nevertheless, I feel that there were enough general concerns around the paper that I have a difficult time recommending acceptance. Even if the purpose of the paper is primarily to drive analytic insights rather than achieve SotA results on big benchmarks, I would recommend the authors to show how these analytic insights can be used to improve models on big datasets to strengthen the paper.

Max-Simes-Fisher (MaSF) is designed for deep neural networks and combines sample features extracted from multiple layers in the network. The method returns a $p$-value for every test sample at a specified significance level. Compared with existing methods for OOD detection, the proposed method achieves similar or better True Positive Rates. As the framework is novel and results shows good performance both in accuracy and computational complexity, I feel that the study deserves to be published.
Gold Metareview 534:
The paper considers the empirical distribution of layer/channel in CNN ,and proposes to use global null tests with Simes and Fisher statistics to aggregate the p-values. This method is competitive while computationally efficient. The underlying theoretical insights are discussed in detail.

The paper received mixed ratings, and the discussions weren't active. So, AC carefully read the paper and inspected all reviews. Reviewer a8KZ comments were factually inaccurate in listing references, and lack substantial feedback on the actual content of the paper. Hence, the review was down-weighted. 

The other negative reviewer Ni17, as an OoD expert, unfortunately did not offer more feedback to author rebuttals. From what AC comprehends, the authors should have clarified their The theoretical guarantee and compared properly with Liu et. al. 2020 energy-score (ES).

Considering the above, AC feels that the study deserves to be published.

The paper investigates the over-parameterization of attention heads in Transformer’s multi-head attention. Authors show that query-key projections are redundant because trained concatenated heads tend to compute their attention patterns on common features. They propose a reparameterized approach allowing the parameters of queries and keys to be shared between heads. This is called “collaborative attention” The paper is well-written and organized, the experiments are thorough.

Gold Metareview 535:
This paper proposes an interesting collaborative multi-head attention (MHA) method to enable heads to share projections, which can reduce parameters and FLOPs of transformer-based models without hurting performance on En-De translation tasks. For pre-trained language models, a tensor decomposition method is used to easily covert the original MHA to its collaborative version without retraining. 

This paper receives 3 weak reject and 1 weak accept recommendations. On one hand, all the reviewers agree that the paper is well motivated and the proposed idea is interesting. On the other hand, all the reviewers also commented that the current empirical results and comparisons are weak, which are not enough to support the paper's main claim. From the current results, it is difficult to draw a conclusion that collaborative MHA is better. 

Specifically, (i) From Table 2, it can be seen that the proposed method is not effective for pre-trained models, i.e., even if the model size is not reduced much, the performance can be dropped significantly. (ii) More experiments, such as QA, more translation/generated tasks will make this paper more convincing. (iii) More rigorous experiments are needed to justify the practical value of the proposed method. If the authors try to emphasize that they go beyond practical realm, then probably a careful re-positioning of the paper is needed, which may not be a trivial task. 

The rebuttal unfortunately did not fully address the reviewers' main concerns. Therefore, the AC regrets that the paper cannot be recommended for acceptance at this time. The authors are encouraged to consider the reviewers' comments when revising the paper for submission elsewhere.

FedGLOMO is communication-efficient that integrates variance-reduction, both at the server and at local client updates. Assumption 4 is not standard and the authors claimed that it holds for alpha = n. I'm not very familiar with federated learning and it is hard to judge for me how restrictive it is. I find the paper well written. There are places where the statement could be improved. The algorithm can be applied to many ML problems.

The paper proposed a TUNIT framework with a guiding network, which could encode style codes for the generator and predict the domain labels for the discriminator. The generator given a source image produces an output that follows the structure of the source yet preserves the style and "domain" details of the reference image. The proposed method additionally adds a pseudo label prediction branch to separate domains based on maximizing the mutual information. The setting is new, it might not make sense in practice.

This paper defines a truly unsupervised image translation scenario. Namely, there are no parallel images or domain labels. To achieve robust performance in this scenario, the authors use 1) clustering and 2) generator-discriminator structure to map images from different domains and generate images for target domains.  

In all, all the reviewers agree that this definition of unsupervised image translation is interesting. However, there are also several concerns for the real-world practical application and empirical results.  Unlike unsupervised text translation whose target language is known, the truly unsupervised image translation is difficult to make sense without identifying what is the target domain. This limits the contribution of this paper to some specific tasks instead of more general tasks. For the empirical results, the selection of data and the hyperparameter K do not convince the reviewers.

This is exciting work that demonstrates the ability of self-modifying networks to solve meta-reinforcement learning problems. The reviewers all agree that this is strong work, and the authors have convincingly addressed most of the concerns the reviewers brought up during the reviewing phase. There are a few lingering questions about the applicability of the baselines, but these are quite minor. The authors have further promised to add analytical comparisons and additional details /motivation on the Hebbian update. Given this, I view this paper quite positively and encourage the authors to integrate the additional experiments and details they mentioned in the feedback stage.

This paper introduces dynamic anchor boxes as a query formulation for detection transformer (DETR) The basic idea is to use explicit positional priors and scale priors from anchor boxes. Anchor boxes are also adjusted layer-by-layer to learn the optimal anchor setting. The proposed query formulation introduces marginal computational overhead. The slow convergence of DETR is likely caused by the multiple mode property of the queries. To solve the problem, explicit positionalpriors are used to improve query-to-feature similarity and accelerate model convergence.

Somewhat borderline paper given the scores, but leaning on the side of accepting mostly because the positive (and weak positive) reviews are a little more persuasive. The negative review is a bit of an outlier; the main issues raised in the negative review are that the novelty is on the lower side or otherwise that the work is incremental. These complaints are largely not shared by the other reviewers, and furthermore seem not like deal-breakers. Still a borderline paper, but fairly safe to accept.

The goal is to learn a discrete two-dimensional representation of the time series data in an interpretable manner. The model is constructed on the basis of self-organizing maps (SOM) and involves reconstruction error in the training. This is one of the best papers I have reviewed in a while. The only question I have is in terms of the medical data. The map learnt by SOM-VAE-prob presented in Fig. 4 appears to have 2 clusters with 'less healthy' patients.

This paper combines probabilistic models, VAEs, and self-organizing maps to learn interpretable representations on time series. The proposed contributions are a novel and interesting combination of existing ideas, in particular, the extension to time-series data by modeling the cluster dynamics. The empirical results show improved unsupervised clustering performance, on both synthetic and real datasets, compared to a number of baselines. The resulting 2D embedding also provides an interpretable visualization.

The reviewers and the AC identified a number of potential weaknesses in the presentation in the original submission: (1) there was insufficient background on SOMs, leaving the readers unable to comprehend the contributions, (2) some of the details about the experiments were missing, such as how the baselines were constructed, (3) additional experiments were needed in regards to the hyper-parameters, such as number of clusters and the weighting in the loss, and (4) Figure 4d required a description of the results.

The revision and the comments by the authors addressed most of these comments, and the reviewers felt that their concerns had been alleviated.

Thus, the reviewers felt the paper should be accepted.

SuNCTt is a new loss designed to speed up the convergence of semi-supervised training. The loss involves the computation of similarity between anchor and other images with the same class. Despite the paper has some interesting results, it lacks of real contributions to show its real contributions. The improvement over SimCLR does not seem to be significant under the same training epochs. Using a small amount of labeled data can reduce computation by half.

The paper proposes to speed-up self-supervised learning for semi-supervised learning by combining self-supervised pretraining and supervised fine-tuning into a single objective. The proposed supervised loss builds on Neighbourhood Components Analysis and soft nearest neighbor losses. Most reviewers are concerned about the novelty of the approach and the significance of empirical results. I agree with both concerns. I appreciate the comparison between $\log \sum \exp$ and $\sum \log \exp$, but it seems a simpler cross entropy loss also achieves a similar goal (potentially somewhat slower). I believe adding more experiments comparing different supervised loss functions across different architectures can help improve the paper.

The paper proposes a trainable way to re-order or recover the ordering of features from sets of examples. This could be used to build a common feature space (or embedding) for a neural net. The paper is overall really hard to follow, statements are often confusing or misleading. The ground-truth feature alignment matrix is almost impractical to collect. The empirical results are also not convincing. The major challenge lies in the supervision needed to train the alignment matrix or function.

After carefully going through the reviews and rebuttal, and looking at the content of the paper as well, I feel there are some issues with the current manuscript. As also pointed out by AnonReviewer5 and AnonReviewer2, the text lacks clarity. From specifically defining what a schema is, to being more explicit about the limitation of the work. 
I understand that the authors are interested in a largely unexplored setting, and hence there might not be a lot of prior work to cement the evaluation protocol. Particularly because of this I think such papers need to be upfront and clear not only in what is the setting and what is the evaluation but also what are the limitations and open problems. 

I do agree that there is value in this direction of research, and that the idea of re-ordering the features using attention (which I have to agree it is reminiscent of Bahdanau et al., ICLR 2015 -- though the semantics of it and its purpose makes it novel here) might be a way forward. But I do think for the paper to make an impact (and be ICLR ready) it needs more work both in the writing and maybe on the experimental side as well (consider some more complex task, or be more explicit on what is the common aspect between tasks in the distribution that can allow chameleon to work)

**Overview** This paper provides a way to combine SVRG and greedy-GQ to improve the algorithm performance. In particular, the finite iteration complexity is improved from $\epsilon^{-3}$ to $\epsilon^{-2}$.

**Pros** The paper is well-written. Reviewers believe this is a solid theoretical work on advancing value-based algorithms for off-policy optimal control. It has sufficient theoretical advancement and experiments demonstrations of the methods. 

**Cons** Some reviewers are concerned that SVRG is not SOTA. SVRG is not used in practice. The techniques appear to be similar to some existing works. 

**Recommendation** The meta-reviewer believes that the paper has solid theoretical contributions. SVRG is a component in the new algorithm to improve the complexity. It does not need to be "useful" or "SOTA". The paper is also well-written. Hence the recommendation is accept.

The paper presents a sound and efficient (but not complete) algorithm for verifying that a piecewise-linear neural network is constant in an Lp ball around a given point. This is a significant contribution towards practical protection from adversarial attacks with theoretical guarantees. The proposed algorithm is shown to be sound (that is, when it returns a result, that result is guaranteed to be correct) and efficient (it is easily parallelizable and can scale to large networks), but is not complete (there exist cases where the algorithm will return "I don't know"). The experiments show good results in practice. The reviewers are positive about the paper, and most initial concerns have been addressed in the rebuttal, with the paper improving as a result. Overall, this is an important contribution worth communicating to the ICLR community, so I'm happy to recommend acceptance.

The paper proposes a novel protocol for examining the inductive biases in learning systems, by quantifying the exemplar-rule trade-off (as measured by the exemplar-vs-rule propensity (EVR) defined in Eq. (2)) while controlling for feature-level bias. 

Reviewers mostly agree that the problem studied in this paper is practically relevant and that the two bias measures are potentially interesting and (jointly) more informative than existing measures such as spurious correlation. However, a shared concern among the reviewers (with confidences scores >=3) is the clarity of the exposition (e.g., many key concepts such as the data conditions are informally specified [Section 2 (Reviewer TPBn)], some key messages not clearly conveyed in the main paper [Section 3 (Reviewer RJtk)], and results inconclusive or not sufficiently supported by the experimental results [for both the synthetic setting (Reviewer RJtk) and the real-world setting (Reviewer yoH5)]. Based on the above concerns, the reviewers were not convinced that this work is well supported in its current state to merit acceptance for publication.
