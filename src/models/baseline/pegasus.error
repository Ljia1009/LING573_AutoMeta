Some weights of PegasusForConditionalGeneration were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google/pegasus-xsum and are newly initialized: ['model.decoder.embed_positions.weight', 'model.encoder.embed_positions.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
